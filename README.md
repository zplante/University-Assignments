# University Assignments
Here is all the code I wrote for a grade during my time at University of California, Santa Cruz. Each directory is a diffrent class, and its title is the class number. For refrence:
### CE 12 - Computer Systems and Assembly Language
This class covered gates, circuts, bitwise logic, and Assembly language(MIPS). The assignments including making gates, full adders, and writing machine code.
### CS 12A - Accelerated Introduction to Programing
An intro class, covering Java and C basics.
### CS 12B - Inrtoduction to Data Structures
Builds on CS 12A, learning more complicated Java and C techniques.
### CS 101 - Analysis of Algorithims
A class dedicated learning fundemental algorithims like Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithim and how to calculate runtime.
### CS 111 - Operating Systems
All asignments involved editing the FreeBSD source code to learn about operating systems and the diffrent algorithims they use.
### CS 112 - Comparitive Programing
Learned the history of programming languages including BASIC, Scheme, OCAML, Smalltalk, and Prolog.
### CS 143 - Natural Langugae Processing
An introduction to NLP using NLTK. Class had two major projects, one for classifying reviews and one for creating a Question answering Machine.
### CS 182 - Databases
An introduction to using SQL, specifically postgreSQL, and utilizing it in applications.
