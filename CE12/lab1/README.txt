Without the number display found in Part B, the best way to recreate it
would be a series of LED lights, like the string seen in Part B. This could
easily communicate a number in binary, with a light on meaning 1 and a light
off meaning 0.

I am unsure of how the RNG works in a computer, though I have heard that it
is based of of "seed" numbers and sometimes the current time is used for this.
This would mean the numbers aren't truely random, but simply simulate an idea
of "randomness."
