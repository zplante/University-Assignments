This program runs Prim's MST algorithim and Dijkstra's SSSP algorithim depending on a flag. To compile, use the command make associated with the included makefile. When executed, include the command line arguments: -P or -D depending on weither you wish to run Prim's or Dijkstra's algorithm, a start vertex for the tree, and an input file to read in a graph. Some sample test input files are included.

in.txt is the example input provided
prim.txt is designed to test Prim's algorithim, but can work on Dijkstra's
dij.txt is designed to test Dijkstra's algorithim, but can work on Prim's
doubling.txt test array doubling
bounds.txt checks that loadWgtGraph checks bounds
