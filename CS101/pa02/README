"I have read and understood the Academic Misconduct Policy for
    Undergraduates, the related sections 102.01-102.016 and 105.15 of the
    UC Santa Cruz Student Policies and Regulations Handbook,
    and the related sections of the class syllabus."

The following files comprise a program that takes in a text file as input and prints adjencent points, as well as an adjecency matrix and is able to invert the graph.

There are also several test cases:
basic.txt is a simple test of the program
dd.txt tests how the program reads in and prints double digit numbers
doubling.txt tests array doubling
bounds.txt checks that the program will not read in edges outside the bounds


Upon running this program, one should realize a double inverted graph appears identical to the original graph
