This program is designed to to input a file repersenting a graph and print the adjacency list as well as a chart showing the dTime, fTime, color, and parent of each node, as well as the same for the inverted matrix, as part of the SCC algorithim.

This program compiles with the command make (using a makefile) and takes up to two command line arguments: a file and an optional flag "-U" denoting an undirected graph.

The test case in.txt is designed to output an identical output to the one in ho10.
