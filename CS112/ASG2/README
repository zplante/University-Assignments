The submitted files amount to the function of  a desk calulator, written in 
OCAML. 

Included in this submition are the files Makefile, bigint.ml, bigint.mli 
maindc.ml, and scanner.mll.

Makefile, bigint.mli, and scanner.mll were written by Wesley Mackey.

bigint.ml and maindc.ml were written by Wesley Mackey but edited by myself to 
include funtions not originally programmed. These include subtraction, 
multiplication, division, exponentials and modulo in bigint.ml and load and 
store in maindc.ml

These functions were based on code also provided by W. Mackey, but were ajusted to account for the new bigint data type created for this assignment.

All functions should work as expected, including + - * / % ^ c d f p l s.
