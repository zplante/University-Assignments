Submitted along with this README is a file titled hzip.st which can compress
and uncompress a file based on the Huffman tree, as well as print the tree
(activated by the -c, -u, and -t commands respectively). The tree function 
works as written. The logic for the -c and -u functions should work, but
difficulty with the given OutBits class was causing them to not run properly 
on my machine.
