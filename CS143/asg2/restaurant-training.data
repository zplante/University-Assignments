Text = "Let me start by saying that, my daughter and I go out to eat at least once a week, and when I find a place to go that we like we become somewhat regulars. I have driven by the hilltop restaurant for several years now but it wasn't untill i recieved a cupon in the mail did i decide to try them. When ariving at the restuarant and going in side it looked like your typical small mom & pop kind of place. We found our way back to the back room and on our way let the waitress know we were there. After about 10 min. she arived with some water and took our drink orders. It was another 10 min. before she came back again with our drinks. We told her we were ready to order and she said she would be rite back, Well you guessed it it was about 5 min before we seen her again. So we finally give her our order my daughter has the chicken fried steak dinner and i order the steak dinner medium rare with baked potato and a vegi. 20 minuets latter our food arives and in that time we did not see our waitress again. The food looked good, and my daughters meal was very much to her liking. But my steak had a funny taste to it I cut a peice and ate it thinking that they must use a very strange seasoning, I tried 2 more bites and just didnt like it but it was on the 4th cut that I was able to tell just what the problem was, as I brought the peice of meat up to my nose I could smell that the steak was spoiled. Not wanting to make a sceen I approached the waitress in the hallway away from all the other customers and let her know of the problem. She took my plate back to the cook and when she returned to my table she told me that the cook said there was nothing wrong with the steak and gave it back. Well needless to say i did not eat it, and i sat and waited for my daughter to finish her meal. When she was done we went to the front counter and waited again for our waitress to finaly come and tally up our bill (I was feeling kind of invisable) We talked about the steak and I asked her to have the cook taste it, and when he did you could see on his face that there was something wrong. when she came back I was informed that because i didnt bring it to her attention Quick enough that there was nothing they could do. They did however offer to cook me another steak to take home with me. But at this point I was not going to sit and wait another 20 min. So I let her know that i would just pay the check, and let every person who would listen to my story know about my experience at The Hilltop Restaurant. That was the most expensive baked potato I have ever eaten. Thank you for allowing me this venue to give my review."

No fillers to detract from the crab, and they are baked, not fried. My dining partner tried the Scallop Cerviche as an appitizer, she was more than pleased. The restaurant is located in the historic district of Phillipsburg in a very old but beautifully restored victorian building and the decor of the rest. reflects the victorian heritage. There is a well appointed bar and the entire restaurant is smoke free. I recommend this new restaurant highly!"

I told the waitress who was concerned and she told the manager "Jeff" who sat eating his dinner three tables over. We waited for him to finish up and come over but finally decided that he didn't intend to. We got up to the register where we promptly asked for a refund and he finally came up there. He said that he would refund my part but not the rest of the group, because we had been there thirty min. I said yes waiting for you to handle this. Even my small daughter told him they didn't eat off their plate after that. He was rude and unconcerned. We left disgusted."

Text = "If you want to eat fairly good food in a lousy atmosphere with snooty hard to locate waiters while practically sitting in your neighbors lap and yelling across the miniture table at your friends because the place is soooo loud, then this is the place for you! This was a special occasion choice for us, highly touted as the place to go for an excellent dining experience. While the food quality was excellent, beautiful and imaginative, everything else about this place was the opposite - high unpleasant. Other friends also went some time later (despite our warnings) and had a similar unpleasant experience. Would never recommend to anyone. Suggestion? Take about the same amount of money, drive a couple of miles south on La Brea to Campanile and have excellent food in a delightful soothing atmosphere with attentive, sweet and prompt waiters, munch on some of the most delicious bread and food in the city and actually enjoy your evening! When you leave you will be full, happy, relaxed and thinking about what delicious menu item you are going to try the NEXT time you can save up enough pennies and come back there. On your way home, swing by Lucques and laugh as you drive by...."

The food a little salty, but in all very good. The portions were large and would fill up most anyone. The service was fantastic. The man was at our table every second we needed something. They didn't have to ask who got what dish, and at the end of the meal the waiter even came out with a crumb catcher to clear the places. The inside is beautiful. They have artwork all over the walls (not paintings in frames). I get the impression it was all hand done, also. =)"

Text = "The wait staff of the old Devonsleigh was great, but I guess they've let most of them go. The one we had was new, and only cleared the table of dirty dishes when the next serving came. They seem vastly understaffed and no bus boys. Waiters won't take drink orders, and the drink guy doesn't come around - and we even had to pour our own wine. Pass on the Oysters Rockefeller appetizer but the shrimp cocktail is great - only 3 but huge ($19). Caesar Salad small and ordinary. Back Ribs ($28) were overdone, dry and hard to cut - and the waiter didn't deliver finger bowls. Linquinin had one (large) shrimp and a couple of scallops ($24) and were OK - better at an Italian place. Prime rib was pretty thin compared to the former Devonsleigh servings and not nearly as tasty. Cheesecake terrible. Molten Chocolate good. Spanish Coffee good for $6. This place has a long ways to go before we'll come back. They want to please but need more staff and the new cooks need to get fired before it's too late for them."

Text = "This is a neat fondue restaurant. It opened three weeks ago. It was a lot of fun. The four of us tried the King's Feast. It starts out with a cheese dip made with beer where you can dip bread, carrots, coliflower, celery or granny smith apples. Next you move onto your choice of three salads, mushrooms (so many that you can't see the lettus, literally), chef, or (what I had) a black rasperry vinegret, which was totally yummy. Third, you have your choice of shrimp, chicken, terioki meat, filet, pot stickers, potatoes, broccoli, summer squash and I think one or two more choices. You dip these in an oil liquid and then choose your favorite of 7 different sauces to flavor your meat. They had horseradish, a lemon sauce, a mustard, blue cheese, terioki, a spinich sauce and plum sauce. For dessert they bring you a chocolate fondue with your choice of addative (we did amaretto) and you get to dip bananas, marshmellows with nuts, strawberries, pineapple (yuk in chocolate), cheesecake, pound cake and I think that was it. I was very hungry when I went in there, the food was surprisingly filling. I thought I was going to have to stop for something on the way home. Price is $40 bucks each. Kind of steap, but if you consider you're getting 4 courses, it's not too bad. Our bus boy was very attentive to our drinks, but our waiter only came out when absolutely necessary. I'd go back, it was a lot of fun."

Unfriendly service....rude and disrepectful remarks made by manager while dealing with the service/food quality issues. The manager said that "they have been in business over 43 years" and told we were the only customers complaining about their restaurant. According to the manager, he owns part of "Sunset Restaurant" business. He abruptly came and took our food off the table and told us "We do not appreciate your business....It is not your conern how our business should be operated" and told us "not to ever...ever...come" to their restaurant again. Importantly....There is a health conerns that I should address to the public. We find a dirt/dead bug in Steamed mussels & steamed clams in our appetizer. How did we deal with the problem? We politely asked for the refund for the portion of our appetizer and the manager refused to do so. Should I contact Local Health Department about this problem? I don't it is worth my time and effort to correct the problem....notifying the local health department. Sunset Restaurant should be just put out of business....They should know it better.....From my experience at Sunset restaurant, I will not visit there again. Customers "PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU SCRUTINIZE YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU CONSUME!!" It was very foolish of this manager at Sunset Restaurant treated its customers in very bad manner. He doesn't understand the power of his customers. He should simply take classes in "Dummies for Principles of Management"."

Text = "My daughter, son-in-law, husband and myself decided to visit this restaurant while visiting on 1/1/05. First of all, we were seated at a booth which was too small to handle the four of us. The hostess should be more considerate when seating people and anticipate their seating needs. Once seated at a larger table, we placed our orders. Three of us ordered a extra salad not to replace the usual side item for the menu choice. Once we received our salads, I had to ask for croutons as none were on the salads. My son-in-law requested new utensils as his were dirty. The waiter never brought any more, we had to take some off another table. Once the food arrived, the side items were missing from the burgers, the waiter informed us that he had substituted the salads for the fries. After arguing with us over it, we insisted that the salads were extra orders for all of us. He brought out two orders of fries, no apology for the mix up. The food was decent and we then received our checks. Not to our surprise, the tickets were wrong. The waiter had charged us $3.99 each for the salads, instead of the $2.49 that was listed on the menu. Since so many things had occurred through-out the dining experience, we asked for a manager. After explaining all of our complaints, the manager not only removed the salad charges, but the beverages and gave us a 20% discount off of our bill. Needless to say, we will not visit this establishment again. We feel that it shouldn't be necessary to call on a manager to make our visit an enjoyable one. Our waiter was named Jason and we believe that Jason needs to be re-trained on how to serve his customers."

Text = "No. 1 Chinese BBQ Restaurant Number One Local Boys Kauai Preliminaries: I am haole, that's not local. Locals are hapa, if they are not haole. Webster's Dictionary defines hapa haole, and haole, but not hapa alone. Haole in case you don't know, are those unlucky not to be Polynesian. Generally applied to mainlanders. When out and about Kauai, for those who pay attention to such things, on low riding small trucks and other teenage idles, can be seen window appliques of the logo: local boys or Kauai'i boys or West side boys. Doubtless, Spielberg, quintessentially attuned to boys and their growing-up, noted this local boy preoccupation culture whilst making his first Jurassic Park on Kauai. One more important element, local boys tend to the ali nui physique of the ancient Polynesians. That means, in short, massive. Number One I had missed till my hapa pal Owen recommended. Owen meets all the elements of local hapa, to be redundant. What's really important on Kauai? To the local boys its cars and food. Where do they put their money? Cars and food. The language for the two has become interchangeable. When first telling me about Number One, he described it as going to pound some food; and, if only sampled, then one has just dented the thing. Number One sits in an old drive-in by the Seven-11 stores on the main drag thru Lihue, same street where Ronald McDonald resides. Going to Number One, locally owned by Chinese for whom English remains a struggle, means you can hit the 7-11 for that Big Gulp bargain drink and then ding the menu a bit further at Number One. Eat-in or Take-out. Efficiently, local boys get the best buys at both locations. Owen describes the portions by gesture to show a plate satisfyingly filled to its edges. There lingers at the reflection a slight smile on his lips, and Owen repeats a paean to the size, whilst repeating the gesture. Note to reader: Owen comes to my shoulders, but I should guess our poundage equal. Owen further advises, one can order 1, 2, or 3 main choices with a choice of rice, including fryed rice, or noodles. "How" he exclaims for emphasis, "Can they do this for the price?" They must mean here the Chinese owners. Reflexively, I think for a moment of macro-economic things, wondering but should I call Alan Greenspan with this anecdotal report of price levels due to in-sourced Chinese cuisine. Or, can this but be a centuries' long trend with which the aging guru already incorporates to his broad vision? After all, I once read somewhere that, as the wag put it, in Manhattan, all Chinese cooking takes place in one vast subterranean kitchen, and then is brought to the surface for distribution. Probably, this is where that dig-a-hole-to-china story got started. Another item the CIA ought to look into. Back to Local. I ask Owen about L&L, one of what I think is a local place. He advises me dismissively, no local, but a franchise from Oahu. Note: L&L opens 24/7. But now Owen, going with the flow, glowingly tells of the Chicken Katsu, with genuine fondness he takes the time to describe the dish in detail. Boneless chicken pieces battered and fried, served with a choice of toppings, including real gravy. Enough of theory: I took myself the next day for a late, by Kauai standards, dinner to Number One. For more information to stay on Kauai and visit Number One yourself, see www.MyPoipuBeach.com/NumberOne. No. 1 Chinese BBQ Restaurant, 3-3160 Kuhio Hwy Lihue, 96766 246 6888"

Text = "It isn't as fancy as some of the barbeque palaces in Georgia, and it isn't as big as the BBQ emporiums in Texas, but it may very well offer the best tasting ribs and brisket I've run into anywhere West or East of the Mississippi. Big City BBQ gets our vote for the Best New Restaurant in August of 2004, and will almost certainly end up on our annual Reader's Choice Awards ballot later this year. The Big City boys are the new guys in town in the fast-growing barbeque arena, but the owners come from extensive prior experience as restauranteurs. High profile Executive Chef, Rasshad Brown (www.rasshad.com), co-founded Big City after more than 15 years of professional culinary experience, including managing kitchens in resorts and corporate restaurants chains. "BBQ with Soul!" they announce on their menu board, sporting such Southern delicacies as fried okra, collard greens, rice and gravy, black-eyed peas, more than a dozen size dishes in all. But, what drives most BBQ aficionados here are the smoked meats, the brisket, ribs, pork, hot links and turkey. All meats are rubbed and spiced for 48 hours, then smoked for up to 12 hours prior to serving. What makes Big City really stand out, other than the quality foods, are their unique dry rubs and barbeque sauces. "Most BBQ sauces are vinegar-based," offered co-owner and catering manager Len Wechsler, "but ours is tomato-based, so it doesn't leave an aftertaste." For the adventurous at heart, you will want to dip into the hot BBQ sauce, my personal favorite, although I did see at least one other guest break a sweat after just one nibble. Soul Food lovers will also appreciate the Fried Catfish, Smothered Chicken Breasts, and Smothered Pork Chops. All "Southern Favorites" are presented as lunch portions (with one piece of meat) or dinner portions (two pieces of meat), and the dinner portions are often more than will reasonably fit on a plate. Oh, and a word about desserts. At my table, we passed around melt-in-your-mouth peach cobbler, pecan pie, and my new post-barbeque favorite, sugar biscuits. The cost of an average meal at Big City BBQ is about $10 per person, maybe a couple dollars more for double dinner portions. Lunch combos are $6.49 and include a BBQ sandwich with any smoked meat, a choice of any side, and a refillable soft drink."

Text = "This is my husband's favorite restaraunt so we often end up here even if we don't care too much for it. Problem is that he loves the burgers, but then feels guilty and orders a salad - healthier - and is NEVER satisfied with the salad. We went with his mom this time and she - being healthy - order the steak salad and was not at all pleased. We had hoped that the salads would be better than before with all the new promo being done, but they are the same - BORING (iceburg lettuce in clumps, boiled sliced egg, diced tomatoes, shredded cheddar) and the meat was not chewable. My husband got the salad with grilled chicken, but again complained. BORING, no flavor to the chicken. I got the hamburger, ordered it medium well and got it medium rare. On every visit, we always have at least one order messed up, so one of us doesn't get served until everyone else is through eating - so I didn't send it back. His mother and I will be sure to out vote him if he wants to go again, unless he promises to get a burger. None of us will try the salad again."

Text = "This was our third attempt at this restaurant in hopes that at some point things would get better. Our first visit, we waited close to 20 min's before a server ever approached our table... They walked by a few times but never really stopped...I guess they thought that if they ignored us we would go away. This is the restaurant that sparked the idea of creating we8there.com this is a true story. Our second attempt was equally frustrating we were publicly scolded for opening a window to let some fresh air in at our table and not once did the server come back to check on our progress, The irony is that we left a tip only because they expected us to not leave a tip from the moment we entered the restaurant, not to mention the scowl on the greeters face as if to say what do you want. Our third and final attempt was our final straw, we were seated next to the server station, if we had been any closer and we would be sitting on the coffee burners. The restaurant was not very busy and there were other tables available. I asked the server if we could move to one of the tables next to the window with the excellent view of the Pacific Ocean, she told us that they were reserving those seats for parties of three or more however she agreed to move us to another two seat table. The only problem the new table was next to another server station, so we declined; to make matters worse we watched as three more couples arrived at the Sandpiper and were promptly seated at the table reserved for parties of three or more. And again our server failed to come back to check on us in fact we received our check almost immediately after we ordered as if we had no need to order anything else off the menu. I guess you are wondering how the food was. The truth is does it really matter, the service was so horrible so who cares! I have vowed that I will never eat at the Sandpiper Restaurant Bar and Grill ever again!"

By the time she returned with our beverages, 4 of us decided on the buffet and the other 2 ordered from the ala carte menu. Not one of us was disappointed. We were just sorry we had a late lunch and couldn't taste everything they had. Every part of the buffet was wonderful. There is something for everyone. You do not have to be a seafood lover to enjoy Goosby's! After dinner, we were planning on seeing a movie. We went to their lounge and discovered they have 20, yes 20 beers on tap!

The sauce we recently had, billed as "the original", bore no resemblence to the original. Besides being the wrong color and flavor, it had the consistency of library paste. The bread appeared to be obtained from a supermarket shelf; the grated cheese was sparingly spooned onto our pasta and then whisked away. The busser stood next to our table and stared at us, waiting to swoop down on us, throughout our entire meal. To add insult to injury, we had to pay $2.00 to park in the restaurant's own lot."

Bland and ordinary crust - In fact the same goes for all the toppings on the "New York style" pizza I ordered. Bland pepperoni, sausage and cheese. Lobster bisque soup seemed canned with all the preservatives and chemicals that go with that process. I can only imagine it comes in 5 gallon cans from the corporate warehouse. Salad was ok, but would have been better if the recipe they use for red wine vinaigrette had more imagination than just red wine vinegar and oil. I don't think they even added salt and pepper to it. Pizza is among my favorite things to eat, and I've had pizza from all over the country and usually never leave disappointed. Some pizza is better than others, and some are really superb. This was a very rare experience where I left confused and surprised - I really was expecting it to be better than little Caesars."

A waiter (Male Asian, no personality either/ like most of the waiters there) come to ask for our order, He gets edgy when we inguire about the roasted duck serving and answers as if annoyed by three simple questions concerning food. Then he rushes the order, left, and did not give us a chance to order drinks until half way thru meal, Upset I informed him politely that he never waited for our drink order, Annoyed he doen't even apologize and brings the drinks and slams them on the table and rudely pushes the napking that my partner was using on the floor to place a can of soda. VERY RUDE, my motto is and I am sure it doesn't take a psychologist to realize that when one is served anywhere impolitely, one does not enjoy the service. We returned to our hotel, sick to our stomachs and upset at the horrible treatment.

We were seated in a crowded area where we had to lean forward if anyone wanted to get to the restrooms and were served by a waitress who acted like your typical high school bubblegum-chewing teen...and she had to be at least 40. It was obvious she thought she had better things to do than serve us. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. The sauce tasted funny, as did the meatballs. Really funny. Rotten, almost. I only ate about half of the spaghetti, paid my bill and left. The next morning, I woke up with incredibly bad food poisoning. I have never been so ill in my life. I hadn't eaten anything after the spaghetti that day so the obvious cause of my food poisoning was the rotten sauce and raw ground meat. I will never go back there again!

Our friends (who shall remain nameless) had arrived early, asked to be seated since they wanted to start the evening off with a drink, and were DENIED a seat until the rest of us arrived! When it turned out that we had 5, not 4 people, in our party as previously thought, they set us at a table where the one additional person ended up sitting out in the walkway! The minimal portions of food and lack of variety were just the beginning... get this: at the very end of our evening, we were getting ready to take a picture (our friend was visiting from miles and miles away!) and as our friend started to snap the photo, the waitress proceeded to give "THE HAND" to the camera, walk briskly past, and huff away! Hm. sorry for getting in your way, ma'am..... I'm not one to ask much from waitstaff, but these characters were quite insulting, without saying a word! I'd say, try the Eliza's on Potrero Hill if you must, and do it during lunch- perhaps they're nicer then... but the Cal/Divis location has 1) Really nice bathrooms 2)cool decor 3) Free Hershey's kisses after your meal BUT all of this is countered by THE REALLY mean waitstaff!!!!

We first tried the Tavolini in the late 90's, and have returned several times, occasionally travelling halfway across the province to enjoy Anna's pasta, garlic bread and tartufo. We are treated like royalty every visit, even though we can never find a way to spend even a hundred dollars there - an amazing value for a full meal, with appetizers, drinks and desserts all around. The Tavolini is a truly special place, and if you have the misfortune to be passing through Brantford, you owe it to yourself to get off the highway, head downtown, lock the car up tight and enjoy some fine, fine food."

Bici is itailian for bicycle so they play off that theme. The food was prepared extremely well, the chef is certified through the American Culinary Federation and won a few awards at his last restaurant. The service was also excellent being a small place our waitress was always in view if we needed anything. This is the best restaurant in southwest Michigan, a must stop."

Text = "We sat for a half an hour before even getting a drink order. The waitress had a party of 10 then us and other tables in the restaurant. Then another 20 minutes before she took the order, because other party was so demanding. Our salads came out with the other people food and before we even got our salads they sat on the tray at least 10 minutes. The waitress had people help bring the food out but no one stayed to help pass out. We got our food with the next 20 minutes, it was good. I did ask to speak to a manager. I had told her that the first thing was this waitress should have never been given the two parties back to back unless someone was going to help. I then told her that before things even started, it took her a half an hour before coming over to our table to get a drink order. The manager's words were "the problem you people's party is that when you party doesn't show up all at once" I cut her off because the first thing is you don't blame the customer because our party didn't show up all together. I never complained about the wait in the lobby. I basically rolled her eyes at me. She talked to me like I didn't know what I was talking about. I told I have been in the restaurant business and retail for over 10 years. All I explained to her was that the waitress should of had more help and unfortunately she did not get it. From what I understand this waitress was in tears earlier. She had had four complaints that night already because of other parties. I don't blame all of it on the waitress I blamed management for no team work. Will never go there again."

Wonderful food, in HUGE portions, and cheap. As a group we usually got burgers and split an order of their fried pretzle bites with honey mustard dipping sause. It cost roughly $11 a person.

Seems like they use the left overs or something or does not use proper material. The ambiance too is dull and boring. It is not at all worth going there and paying for that junk food.

Since busboys are to take care of the drink orders, alcoholic beverages might not make it in time, since only waiters are trained to handle them. Other than that and the occasional messy floor, the diner is not so bad. The food is WAY sub-par considering I grew up eating authentic Mexican food, not Tex-Mex as it should be applied to this specific branch of dining. Alcoholic drinks, on the other hand, are taken care of with much more seriousness. Although the place is messy and the food is less than expected, the waiters do provide plenty of kindness and sincerity to make your dining experience enjoyable."

Text = "We go here regularly; convenient, no downtown traffic, etc, and the food's o.k. (a little pricey- $20-26 each), but we're willing to endure the prices if the food is good. Lately, however, it's been hard spending $150+ on dinner here when the food has declined. There was a time when I'd give this restaurant (for its food) a "5" -- when chef Ted Tyburski was working there. He wasn't head chef at the time, but he did an outstanding job, with extra attention to detail. I heard he's now at a downtown Cleveland restaurant (Metropolitan?) whipping up some great dishes there. Since the head chef at Don's left, though, the menu changed, and some of the traditional, "signature" items (i.e.: scallops with balsamic vinegar reduction sauce, beef Wellington) were removed from the menu, to be replaced by dishes that aren't nearly as good. I understand that a new, incoming head chef might not want to prepare the old chef's dishes, and might want to establish his own "signature" dishes, but when the dish is consistently good, why mess with it? Why let pride or vanity step in? Since then, we often feel like we're "guinea pigs" for new experimental dishes that keep showing up (and aren't that good). Guess the head chef is still searching for some kind of dish he can call his own. My vote: Hope the chef (or owner) reads this review and puts Don's traditional items back on the menu. Until then, you never know if what you order will be good.. or not....."

Our young & giddy waitress was far too informal and chatty with our table, even going as far as rubbing my boyfriend's shaven head, asking to see a ring on one of our guests' fingers, and making jokes about waitresses from Hooters, which, I might add, is likely where she received her training. This, my friends, is not in line with any 5-star dining I've ever enjoyed. No apologies, just excuses from the wait staff about how late the food was and how slow the service was. The non-certified (and very young) sommelier was also sub-par in mannerisms and in talent. When we ordered a bottle of Chardonney that was no longer in stock, he attempted to upgrade our selection with a much more pricey label without even informing us of the price jump. I would not have minded the bubble-gum-service if I was paying 2- or 3-star prices, wearing jeans and a t-shirt, but for a place where a side of mash potatoes is pricier than a huge plate of Hooter's hot-wings, you'd think they could afford to hire some wait staff with class. Very disappointing, considering the hype it has recieved. I won't be back, given the selection of "real" fine-dining restaurants Dallas has to offer. Even sister-restaurant "Steel" exhibits more class; makes you wonder why they don't lend some professional training to it's struggling sibling-- merely a "wanna-be" in the fine-dining arena. This was a waste of time & money."

I am not a fan of white meat but their chicken strips(chicken crispers) are so juicy and tasty that it is unbelievable. Every time I get paid I head out to Chili's. Oh yeah! I have to mention the wonderful service. There has never been a time that I came across a rude waiter or waitress. They are definitely out to please. On a scale from 1 to 10 I give Chili's a 11!!!"

Prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity. 4 of our party of 8 got our food within a reasonable time, the other 4 , well we had to wait and then inquire and then get the manager over 2 times before we finally got our food 3 minutes after the previous 4 arrived. Our drinks were never checked or refreshed until we finally got up and got them ourselves. The food was exotic game and I think it must have been prepared by an exotic cook also. tough and not very appetizing. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Dallas. I don't see how they have been open for the year they have been in business. it's certainly not due to return customers. I recommend McDonalds over this lousy restaurant anyday."

Everything is made fresh and there are many people making the food right there to replace what has been taken. Besides the sushi there is other japanese style dishes including various seafood salads, fried rice, various styles of fish, crablegs (dinner), shrimp (dinner), and a whole soup and desert buffet. They don't just serve 5-6 types of sushi either. There must be 20-25 types of sushi at one time. I highly recommend this to anyone. As far as people complaining about the long wait times, its probably the most popular sushi place in schaumberg alone! It's also in woodfield mall, chicago's busiest shopping place. The wait is worth it."

Located right across the street from DC's famous Eastern Market, Tunnicliff's offers great food at great prices (they specialize in excellent Cajun dishes.) On warm evenings, it is pleasant to take advantage of their outside seating, and on weekends when Eastern Market is open, one can have a great meal here after a day of shopping for fresh produce and loveable flea-market stuff. Recently, they remodeled, giving the place a shiny new look to replace the old, almost decrepit look it had had previously. For the love of all things sacred, try the gumbo!!!"

With choices ranging from fresh pasta with langostinos sauteed in garlic and basil, to my personal favorite, roast duck in a sweet fig sauce served over red cabbage and mashed potatoes to the World Grill Platter, a sampler of crab cakes, gulf shrimp and filet mignon, they have something for everyone. The menu selections can vary by season. You will start with fresh bread with strawberry butter. Be sure to try the appetizers and leave room for the oversized deserts. There is a large wine selection, both local and imports as well a treat for the vodka lovers, at least 40 different varieties and flavors to choose from. Definitely worth the trip!

While pregnant, I had a huge craving for one of the burgers and drove about 45 mins and waited for them to open to get one. You can't eat blue cheese while preggy (listeria concern), so I asked for it on the side. No can do! There is no deviation on the burger, pregnant or not. They pointed out the "no substitution" language, but I didn't want a sub, just put it on the side. Anyway, they have a right to run the biz w/ food first, customers not and I have a right to let others know and go to the Apple Pan, which I loved, to satisfy my pregnancy cravings. Its a shame, b/c I really liked this place but no way will I go back and that goes about 1000x for my (protective given my condition) hubby. So just be forewarned if you do go there.

We were told upfront that they were short-handed which was fine, so we just expected to have a slow meal. Things however, went from bad to "are you kidding me?!" We waited an hour to receive overcooked, dried out, luke-warm crab cakes and were still missing half our sides  which we never even received by the time we finished the hockey pucks. The sides we did get looked worse than dishes taken off people's tables AFTER they've eaten. I've thrown out better looking food than some of the garnishes on our plates. To top it off, the bill was almost $200, and this started out as a lunch! (it was after 5 by the time we left) The waitress/barmaid had the nerve to act perplexed when we asked to talk to a manager. After being told to wait while she looked for a manager, and then came back, and said there was no manager in the building, we had to get up and hunt for someone of authority, to kindly take something off the check as compensation for our horrid experience. As we were negotiating, at least 2 other couples overheard our complaints, and also left...BEFORE having to endure the worst meal ever."

Many of my associates have had good dining experiences at Glowbal but to be honest, I have heard a few bad things about them too. I decided to try the so called new, trendy and hip Vancouver hot spot for the first time on a busy Sat night. Mabye the weekend is not the right time to go to Glowbal as our experience was soured by a very stressed out staff and a less than impressive dinning experience. Our hostess welcomed us upon arrival with a smile and was pleasant. Our server was a whole different story. I did feel a bit for her as she was very busy that night. I have a few friends that work in the hospitality industry so I have been educated on the stresses of a busy night. My date was wanting a glass of wine but by the time our server got around to asking us for our beverage order, the thought of waiting for another 15 minutes for our cocktails turned us off. We tried a few satays and were dissapointed with our selections. The skewers were a bit on the tough side but the flavours were interesting. A bit too small for us so we tried a salad and the scallop appetizer. Both dishes were small and unappealing. We decided that ordering entrees would be a waste of our money and obviously the kitchen was not staffed to handle the busy night. We asked for our bill and the server did not even ask us why we were leaving so soon. (about 50 minutes) We were not happy with our night out so we ventured down the street to Cioppinos. The night ended on a pleasant note but would have been great if we had never ventured to Glowbal. Too bad....for such high expectaions, we left with a bitter memory of this so called trendy Vancouver hot spot."

The folks at Restaurant Aubergine were packed, and they suggested Le Quai as being on par with their cuisine. We found a charming, small place, so dimly lit by candlelight that we coudln't read the menus. Our waiter gave us the briefest details about the specials and then tried to push a $175 bottle of wine on us. Prices were excessive for the quality and artfullness of the food. There is a difference between crass and class and this place definitely landed in the former. After a $36 3 oz slipper tail appetizer and a $15 gorgonzola/walnut salad that was mediocre and over-dressed, we had two flavorful main courses - the lamb chops and a chilean seabass, each hovering at the $28 mark. After two $7.50 cups of coffee (no refills) and a passable cobbler for dessert, we were handed a bill for over $125, which included two $10 split plate charges, tacky at best. The service was arrogant and patronizing, the prices extreme and the food was certainly not worth a second visit."

PROBABLY great for after-work cocktails and beers (they have a few Japanese beers- not easy to find in the Mission District.) However, their sushi is disappointing. Perhaps it's the incredible use of the 'shiso' leaf (beefsteak plant, that's what the dictionary says) which, although pleasant at times, can be an overpowering experience... The spicy tuna, spider roll, both included shiso leaves which we picked out as if we were doing a biology experiment. Service was pretty bad- our order took FORTY MINUTES, with NO attention from the waitstaff in between! Prices aren't that much lower than that in downtown SF, and Hana-zen or Sushi Groove do sushi much much better, and at comparable prices. Also, Yo's does not have rainbow rolls. Or, if you're in the Mission and dying for sushi, you might want to check out that place on Cortland in Bernal Heights, only a few minutes walk away. ""

After everyone had been served they were offered chicken, but were actually served shrimp! My wife had three shrimps, after a search, with the waitress. But she brought another bowl with five shrimps later The curry itself was not at all tasty, too much flour, and bland - more like a floury gravy. Though the Staff did reduce my wife's and my bill by fifteen percent."

My father wanted to complain about the service and the food but my mother was too polite to allow him to to so. Instead of complaining, my parents started arguing. The food was very small and was not very tasty. My father had the Pork chop and it had hair in it. My mother tried a few of the satays. Tasted alright but were very small. My brother tried the salmon and I had the tuna. Both were overdone and resembled what you get on an airplane. Service was very robotic. She was stiff like a cardboard cut out. Desserts were average. Creme brulee was creative but very small. There are better restaurants in Vancouver."

First of all, they charge extra and tack on additional prices to your ticket for such things as delivery (although menus state delivery is free), paying by check, and requestion even the smalled change to an order (such as requesting fried rice with no veggies). In addition, the shrimp fried rice was an extra charge, only to have so little shrimp in the fried rice I might as well have saved my money and just ordered plain fried rice, oh, except for the fact that I would have still be charged extra for the "effort" it takes to not put veggies in it. Also, I requested that they be careful to not overcook the crab rangoon, only to have to break the corners off because they were so overcooked and hard. All in all, 15% of my bill was for "extras" that should never be considered extras when satisfying the simplest of customer service requests. The food was less than satisfying, the extra charges did nothing to help their customer service, and now I am ticked off at myself for having ordered from them."

Text = "I and several friends went to North Conway to visit a collegue of ours who lives there. She and I, along with my 9 month old baby got to the restaurant first and asked if we could be seated. The remainder of our party was delayed by 15 minutes and in the meantime we ordered wine and appetizers for the whole table (6 of us). Right after the wine was opened and the appetizers delivered a woman came to the table and started clearing the seats that were for the rest of our party. Only when we asked what she was doing did she rudely say she was clearing the table because our guests didn't show up and they needed to seat the table (mind you we already had food ordered and sitting on this table). We were told that we could all shove ourselves around a table meant for 3 people. We tried to fit the chairs and the high chair around the small table but it would not work at which time we asked for the bill. If the restaurant had a policy of not seating a party until everyone was there, they should have said so. If they choose to break their rule then they should stick by their decision. It was THE WORST I've ever been treated at a restaurant and left me with the impression they only cared about getting as much money as they could. Money over customer satisfaction. Bad - bad - bad! We took our whole party over to Horsefeathers and had one of the best nights of our life. Needless to say we had a rather large dining bill and were more than happy to leave a very large tip for the waiter - too bad Bellini's missed out."

Text = "Delancey Street is unique in that it is staffed completely by recovering drug addicts, alcoholics, and ex-convicts, who work in exchange for rehabilitation services and housing in the Delancey Street Foundation complex within which the restaurant is located. Opened in 1991 in a deserted area south of the Bay Bridge, it's now in the heart of what has become the upscale neighborhood known as South Beach. When eating here, you can feel good about supporting the organization's mission and helping your less fortunate fellow man, while at the same time enjoying one of San Francisco's finest dining experiences. The slightly austere but attractive interior is decorated with generous displays of fresh produce and flowers, and the large windows overlooking the Embarcadero offer a perfect view of the nearby bridge. There's a small outdoor patio used whenever the weather allows (summer nights here can be foggy and damp). Perhaps because they want to prove themselves capable, or possibly because their self-esteem has been bolstered by the benefits of the program, every wait person is friendly, attentive, and genuinely eager to please. The staffs at many of the city's high class dining spots could learn a lesson or two from these servers. In a word, the food preparation here is impeccable. I have eaten here at least a dozen times, have always ordered something different, and have never been disappointed with my choice. The menu is eclectic, offering samples of home cooking from around the world. Selections are as diverse as Yankee Pot Roast, Thai Red Curry Prawns, Caribbean Grilled Chicken Breast with Mango Sauce, and Moroccan Chicken. Some of the best food is from the grill or rotisserie, including loin of pork, leg of lamb, and a huge slab of rare beef crusted in black peppercorns and a natural juice that moistens the huge pile of garlic mashed potatoes on which it rests. Equally good are the barbecued chicken and baby back ribs combination and the spit-roasted rosemary chicken. There's also a selection of pastas, the best of which is a highly spiced version of Penne Arrabbiata. The Spinach Salad is a great starter; if you have the room, any one of the desserts is a treat. Amazingly, the huge portions don't command hefty prices - most entrees are less than $15.00, and chances are you'll leave with a doggie bag containing enough for a second meal. Beer and wine are available. As with all areas of San Francisco, street parking is very difficult, but public transportation here is not a viable option. Open for lunch 11:00am - 3:00pm Tuesday-Friday; dinner 5:30 - 11:00pm Tuesday - Sunday; brunch from 10:00am - 5:30pm Saturday and Sunday. Reservations are recommended. Trust me - this is one place where repeat visits are guaranteed."

The Chicken Amaretto over linguine was fantastic as the experience continued to satisfy. Chicken isn't supposed to taste this good! To finsih the experience the canoli and espresso was awesome.

Coffee and water were slow in coming, and not refilled until the check was brought out. The waitress never checked in to make sure things were o.k.

We were offered discounts to this and a sister-restaurant, which we declined.

Text = "I went to the Villa Tronco with a group of friends. I am a college student at USC, as are they. It was a friend's birthday dinner. There were seven of us. I understand that reservations were made for eight. The food is fairly expensive, although, not unreasonable for a small Italian restaurant located in the city. I was in the mood for pasta and a number of us were watching our wallets. Most of us ended up ordering the same or similar dishes. The salad arrived. Although it was small, it was fine with a light lemony dressing. The taste and freshness whetted us for the entree. Our drinks were not full, our waitress had no personality, she never checked on us, or came to ask us how we were--all the usual things that wait staff does. The entrees arrived. The food was awful. I almost sent mine back on the spot but decided against it because I didn't want to detract from the birthday spirit. I should have sent it back. The pasta although not mushy was waterlogged, incredibly bland, and probably wasn't even semolina. I had a combination plate hoping that I could sample some delicious ravioli, lasagna, and rigatoni in their respective sauces. The tomato sauce was a diluted tomato puree that certainly lacked tomato flavor and had no herbs or spice. None. The lasagna had no flavor, and I could not bring myself to eat it with its mushy blobs of browned hamburger (not likely that it was even ground chuck). The cream sauce on the rigatoni was light and pleasant even if the pasta itself was anything but. The garnish was a sprinkle of parsley that was in the cream sauce on the rigatoni. So it wasn't actually garnish. The presentation on-the-whole was awful. It looked like a cafeteria plate. My friend had the eggplant parmesan of which she could only eat half although she hadn't eaten. She paid so much for it that she took the other half of the miniscule portion home and ate it this morning as breakfast because of monetary guilt and spite. Another friend of mine described her food as "gross" with "watery tomato" from a can. Another offered her sympathy because she didn't have the meatballs to "break it up." I think you get the picture. Fortunately, the birthday girl enjoyed her dish that was some $20-something dollar creation. I would gladly have paid a little more if only I had known. I planned to speak to the manager to express my displeasure, but had every intention of paying (and none of tipping). Our checks came. Gratuity had been added. Our party of seven were seated in separate booths, served at different times. The gratuity was a surprise and a shock. The 20% addition to the bill unjustified. One of the checks was calculated wrong. I spoke to manager and asked the gratuity be removed. It was minor, but it was at least $3.00 on our checks. It would have made us more content. I explained the lack of presentation, the waitress who gave us no attention, the empty drinks, the bad food, the server who asked "Who had the eggplant parm?" I explained that we weren't served as a party or seated as one. I got nowhere. I was told more or less that we had been done a favor by getting reservations because they were busy. There were at least three empty booths immediately surrounding us. There was no bustle, no wait, no one eating. I was told that whoever made the reservations understood the arrangement. I told them that they had expected we would have been served together. I explained the entire party's discontent and disappointment. Surely, reservations are not a contract that says the diners must be pleased with the dining and service. I was told that because my friend had gotten a free piece of cheesecake I was in no place to complain. And lastly, I was told that I had an excellent waitress. I thought about causing a seen but could see that Carmella (the manager) was likely to escalate the situation to something inappropriate. We were forced to tip the bad waitress, given no respect as costumers, given no compensation for our discontent, and made to pay for slop that any fast food chain could produce if they went Italian. I have had poor dishes, but this amount of disrespect is new. Olive Garden does it better."

To begin with, their menu is extremely overpriced, with wine prices being the highest of any restaurant in Southeast Michigan. The service was horrible. Our waitress forgot our drinks, and brought them only after two reminders. We ordered a salad, and never received it. After requesting bread twice, we were told that the kitchen was "out of bread". When we asked for a bread substitute, we received stale cold pita bread. We ordered tuna for the entree, which was cold and very bland. When we confronted the owner about the disappointing experience we had, he seemed apathetic. To top it off, we paid what we would have at a 5-star restaurant, while we could have received better food and service at a fast-food restaurant!!! There are MUCH better restaurants in the area- don't waste your time and money at 227 Bistro!!"

As I'm still relatively new to the area, I'm still trying to find my 'favorite' place to get my weekly dose of mexican. The prices - also reasonable. The atmospere - who cares, I always take it to go. The service - whoa, the service is TERRIBLE!!! I know exactly who this guy was referring to; the lady behind the counter with the snotty look on her face. I've been in there 4 or 5 times, and every time I've been in there she's got this pissed off expression on her face. In all honesty, I should've given them a 3 on service as the other lady always seems pleasant and there's a guy who works there at times who always seems upbeat and cheerful. But it's that angry-at-the-world lady who dragged the service score down to a 1."

Text = "I had previously had fair experiences with this place before but now I will never go back. The overpriced food should at least ensure above average service. But it didn't. The waitress couldn't remember who ordered what, then most of the table had to reorder after already sitting there for 20 minutes, next she brought our orders out at separate times, lastly my plate was the most expensive and yet it was a very simple item to make which I had before and just by looking at it I could tell that it was terribly over cooked. At this point I had lost my appetite with the attempt to eat my food. I ended up not eating much of anything and by the time I had received my food everyone else was nearly done eating and it was pointless to get them to remake my food. On top of all of this the waitress had the gall to complain about the modest tip that was left for her as a hint of "you are not doing you job" which I overheard her say while passing the kitchen."

I love their coconut shrimp with honey mustard and order it almost every time. My husband is allergic to white flour but still finds many dishes from which to choose. We have brought our vegetarian relatives & they were equally pleased with their dishes. My only suggestion--a house salad could be included with the entree, with the option of ordering a fancier salad if desired at an extra cost. The desserts all sound wonderful--unfortunately we never have room. Maybe next time we'll get one to go & enjoy it later!"

Text = "Where to start... We were in Ottawa for the weekend and we went to Oregano's for lunch on a Saturday and found the $9.95 buffet to be bland, understocked and lacking in vegetarian friendly fare...One of the buffet dishes was Kraft Dinner! - carefully disguised as Scoobi Doo pasta with ham and cheese! The potato soup in the buffet was good. Since I didn't like the look of the buffet, I ordered the cheese manicotti for $14. What I got was two tubes of pasta smothered in rubbery mozzarella cheese that you had to saw through... There was no salad, no bread stick, nothing for the $14 but the two small pasta tubes... I also ordered an appetizer - Bruschetta. The bruschetta was $6 and consisted of three small pieces of Focaccia which together made up less than half of the circular loaf. There was easily twice as much onion in the bruschetta topping as there was tomato and since the same tough & rubbery cheese was melted on top, the topping was hot like the bread - not how its supposed to be. For drinks we had a wide variety: hot chocolate which came without whipped cream; chocolate milk which appeared to be made from Brown Cow syrup; a rye and ginger ale which was moderately priced at $3.50, a pint of beer that appeared to be less than a full pint; and a diet pepsi which came to the table in a can and appeared on the bill for $2.25! $2.25 for a can of pop!!! I'm sure this sounds like nothing more than sour grapes but honestly, this was the worst restaurant I have been to in years, anywhere. Poor food and very poor value. I've been to much more expensive restaurants and left feeling like I got good value, here we left feeling like we'd fallen into a tourist trap and been had. Our total LUNCH bill for four people with only 3 alcoholic drinks was $80! Oregano's was definitely the low point of my weekend in Ottawa."

However, the food was absolutely horrible. I'm amazed this place has been in business since the late 60's/early 70's. I wouldn't give the food to my dog, let alone the poor starving rat living in my garage. After eating one plate of the "all you can eat" garbage, I immediatly felt sick to my stomach. It was not a pleasant sensation, and the gurgling taking place deep in my bowels was similar to the effects of drinking a gallon of milk, followed by $8 worth of Taco Bell, and chased with a can of refried beans. Which remindes me, the "refried beans" (put in quotes because I'm not sure what they actually were) resembled more of a dry, scaly pile of mud mixed with a little sand, and maybe some cat vomit. Next time, if you're looking for something that's edible for $9.99, feed your cat some popcorn and cheese, wait for it to vomit, and eat that instead."

Especially the Tank with Jelly fish (beautiful) and the running water fall. The decor is pleasant too. We ordered an appetizer of Crab Rangoon (won-tons) and I was pleasantly surprised to see crab in it. The sauce that they served with it was less desiring. My Wife ordered the Combination Fried Rice and I ordered the lunch Sui Sui Noodles (diced chicken, green onions, Chinese noodles, sauce) and a cup of Hot & Sour Soup. The service was not bad. Our server was present when we needed her and was friendly. When the food came my wife mentioned how something did not smell quite right but I was stuffed up and could not smell it. I ignored her and ate away. The Soup was ok nothing spectacular, I tried some of the fried rice and it was bland but had a good taste to it. The Sui Sui noodles had a spicy kick to it and I enjoyed the bite but the noodles were a bit too greasy. As far as size portions, there was more than enough food and for the sizes it was fairly priced. BUT, both my Wife and I felt sick immediately after leaving he restaurant. Something about the food made both of us feel nauseous. I then had wished that I had listened to my wife when she said something did not smell right. We definitely will not be returning to this restaurant."

The "book" menu is full of a variety of not only spicy dishes, but non-spicy ones, both meat and vegetarian dishes and a great dessert menu. The food is prepared really quickly (despite the large volume of customers we experienced at the time) and always of highest quality. One of my favorites, the coconut steamed rice, tastes better than any coconut rice I've had in any Thai restaurant. The one downside might be the crowds of people in the restaurant. It's always busy. However, they offer a fantastic drink list (both alcoholic and virgin) of unique tropical drinks. Everyone I've taken to Tropika have enjoyed themselves immensely and plan on coming back with their friends. An outstanding restaurant with moderate prices."

But the meatballs were outstanding, again I hadn't had meatballs this good since my ex girlfriend's grandmother used to make them over 20 years ago. Homemade sausage that was absolutely delightful. Baby eggplant appetizer was amazing. Lasagna out of this world, gnocchi with bolognese sauce "bravo". The service was truely amazing.

The quality of the service is not the same and the quality of the food has decreased dramatically. Our last 3 experiences left us looking for another favorite restaurant. I would no longer recommend it to anyone."

Text = "Sindicato Do Chopp has several locations around Rio. Two of the best are the one on Avenida Atlantica in Copacabana (because of the beach view and the fact that folks come in wearing beach wear), and the Ipanema loaction. At both the food is above average, the prices are great, and all locations have several TVs so on football days they resemble American Sports taverns. The steaks are great, during the week the Ipanema location has a buffet for lunch at about $4(US) a person. If you want to try Brazilian beer this a great place to do it. Chopp (pronounced show-peh) means draught beer and they have lots of it. Not to be missed by serious beer cultists or folks looking for a tavern atmosphere."

Text = "Me and my girlfriend went to Lamotte's one evening looking for a pleasant dinner. It was about 7 pm. We were the only table and we requested the pattio area that our friends suggested. They told us that the pattio area was closed, but about 20 minutes after we got there, we saw our server take a group of 5 back to this pattio area. Our waitress seemed to give us an attitude whenever we asked for something. Our tabled cloth was very wrinkley, and somewhat damp. I ordered a steak medium rare, and it came out well done. My wife ordered chicken alfredo, and it looked like soup. A large man was constantly walking around the restauraunt and starrign at us, making us feel most uncomfortable being that we were the only table in our section. When I asked to speak to a manager, it took about 20 minutes for him to come see me. And what really made me angry, was that after enduring all that suffering, all he offered me and my wife was a slice of pie... A SLICE OF PIE!!! Well we took it none the less. We reccomend this restaurant to NO ONE! Stay away from this awful place."

I decided, since it was Holiday, to treat some of the younger generation within my family, to a nice meal, and a movie. The movie "Maid In Heaven" was very good! However, prior to that we went over to the TGIF within the Town Center. 1. We waited 10 minutes, after being seated, before I asked for our server. 2. We received no water! 3. So naturally, the hostess that I am, I allowed my guess to order what they wanted. They chose the hi-ended items. 4. Finally we met our server, and, he apologized, explaining that they were in the back figuring out who was going to serve who. 5. Dah!!! TMI - too much info, I don't want to know that. 6. I want to be served. I explained that we were going to the movies across the lot. I ordered soup, I got no spoon! 7. The soup came with my entree, however, it was just liquid. 8. I returned it asking for a better serving, It was luke warm. 9. All the entrees ordered were either burned, or cooked twice. 10. It was awful. I displayed it all to the manager, and he gave me a DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, HE SHOULD HAVE WAIVED THE ENTIRE MEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm over with that CHAIN for a while. I was embarrased, it was supposed to be a treat. My guess were not impressed, and it reflected BAD on part, for making such a selection to dine in. :-( vthomas4513@yahoo.com"

Text = "Simply Put: Racist attitudes towards minorities. The Incident: My group of 12 consisted obviously of minorities. We arrived at 7:50 PM on a Saturday night. A party of 16, multiple parties of 8, and everyone else were seated first before we were even considered (they all arrived after us). At 10:00 PM I was finally able to speak with the manager. (There was only one other party waiting at the restaurant waiting). Alan told me quite frankly: "you were told to wait 2 hours and we still need you to wait" and basically walked away. No apologies, no nothing! If everyone at the Joe's Crabshack was made to wait equally or if the staff admitted to a scheduling error on their part, I wouldn't be as disgusted with their establishment as I am now. I would never even consider dining there again. For a full recap of my incident please visit http://www.geocities.com/supersizebri Corporate Office Action: They called me and apologized. They even offered to send "incentives" for damage control. I respectfully declined. My mission is to tell everyone about their poor corporate mentality and the types of belittling mgmt they hire in Long Beach. Review submitted by: Brian Ki"

Duck was sent back as it was undercooked....came back pretty much the same. The manager leaned over the table to set it in front of me. There was no silverware present, but this was not noticed., I had to ask for new silverware, as I thought that using my hands was inappropriate. Side dish was forgotten and arrived as the meal was literally over. The waiter never returned to replenish wine...we did it ourselves. I went to complain to the manager prior to dessert. He seemed totally shocked, offered no apologies and never came near us again.....the old concept of " if you avoid the problem, it will go away". He stood there shaking with no clue as to how to handle a dissatisfied guest. Well, we did go away, never to return. Not a soul to say good bye or thank you as you leave, having spent close to 250 dollars for 3. Dismal is the only way to describe it. Too mnay other choices in the city...who needs attitude !!!"

Text = "Okay, heres the deal...I moved here about 4 years ago and the was told to visit Tunni's ASAP. I did, and boy, was it fun! Every night the local hill residents made their way to this place for conversation, drinks and AMAZING food. The owner at the time, Current executive director of the washington restaurant association, Lynne Breaux, was always smiling and welcoming friends/ guests along with her popular charismatic staff. This place was the "Cheers" of Capitol Hill. It is unfortunate that the new owner or new general manager is not more aware of how they have damaged the Eastern Market scene by dulling and sterilizing this historic place. All notion of fun is GONE! 4 years ago when you walked through those doors on ANY given night there would be people playing cards, discussing politics, discussing bargains they found that weekend at the market, announcing engagements, etc. Local soccer leagues ( adult and youth) would be celebrating their wins or losses, and there was always a general feeling of community. Today....I wasnt sure if it was alright to speak at all, and no one was celebrating anything! Well, what was is gone and in the past but I cant help but wonder how an establishment that provided so many generations of Washingtonians and newcomers alike such a welcoming gathering place to meet and wind down, became the very place I dont want to ever go again...i wonder if they know that the experience isnt even a quarter of what it used to be, and that for the price of a single brunch I could walk across the street and buy the goods myself and feed a group. I never even looked at the prices before, I was too busy having fun!! A meal for one at Tunni's now...$15-30 A meal at Tunni"s Before...PRICELESS!! Take your Gramma ."

We chose the House of Blues (http://www.hob.com/) which is right next to the Cirque's white Big Tent looking building. Walking in you notice the crazy shoes that surround the doorway - no blue suede though - and of course recorded blues music was playing throughout. The decor is dark with good sunlight coming in. Folk art is all over the walls and interior pillars. I understand you can take the art home for a price. We started out with Cat Bites which is an appetizer of fried Catfish pieces with capons and string fried potatoes. It was OK. My mother and wife had hamburgers($8.95, cheese $9.40) which were very good. They had a strong but not overbearing charcoal taste. I had a shrimp Po Boy($10.95) which is medium sized fried shrimp put in a soft Hoagie bread- delicious. Good French Fries came with the meals. Good Eats, Good Ambiance."

Living in the Washington DC metropolitan area we often dine at several 5 star restaurants, yet, La Rosa Negra is our favorite  we wish it was located in DC. We have referred numerous friends and they too have raved about the food, ambiance, and reasonable prices, have become repeat customers and referred their family and friends.

Text = "Ironic, but it's not easy to find traditional Tahitian cuisine (ma'a) in Tahiti. The big hotels offer their Polynesian Night feasts but other than that, where are the little Tahitian restaurants where one can get breadfruit (uru), taro, red banana and other specialities that I crave when in Polynesia? It's true that "you haven't really been there until you've eaten the food" so I need to find a place where the locals go! On the island of Moorea, Chez Capo fulfills my obsession with Tahitian cuisine. The retaurant in Haapiti is a tiny thatched-roof bistro under a great breadfruit tree. Just off the main road, you see chickens wandering around the yard and local residents going about their daily business and you KNOW you are finally in Tahiti! The food at Chez Capo reflects the essence of Tahitian culture with offerings of mahi-mahi in vanilla sauce, shrimp in coconut milk, tender goat curry. The poisson cru (a national dish of marinated raw fish) is served up in large portions with french bread for dipping the sauce. I loved the crispy uru (breadfruit) chips served complimentary with each meal and the baked uru, taro, plaintain and red banana that accompanied each plate. Chez Capo has become "our place" for traditional Tahitian food when we're in Haapiti, Moorea. Joe loves the uru and banana chips as a "take out" snack while walking the nearby beach. The staff at Chez Capo is "family" and the atmosphere is the idyllic little beach cafe on a tropical island in a novel you may have read. Chez Capo is not a "tourist trap"; the locals eat here so the price is right! Be sure to try the Saturday "all you can eat" buffet and the Sunday Polynesian feast! Hours change so check when you're on the island!"

Text = "Gigantic Green Sugar Snap Peas, Peppers and Pears adorn the outside walls of this Modern American Cafe. As you step inside, bursts of Orange, Tangerine, Red and Purple rest on your eyes; the aroma from the wide open kitchen right in front of you plays with your sense of smell and you begin to salivate and your appetite aroused. An inviting scene of chefs in action, steam coming from the stove, masterpieces laid out on the counter. Then the host ignores you and your back to reality. A bit of a turn off to start your evening, especially if you are a stickler for good and sincere service. We are seated on tapestry-like covered sofas, and get a glimpse of the mural on the back wall with colorful and once again gigantic fruits and vegetables. Sunflower seed crusted bread and sweet potato spread is brought to our table, YUM! This renders you a peak into the eclectic menu ahead of you. Thyme square is known for using organic ingredients and serving creative vegetarian and vegan choices. These dishes, often updated between seasons, are so full of flavor and have generous proportions that you won't go missing the beef, chicken or fish! They do offer meat and fish selections such as this wonderful dish of organic Sirloin from Ridgefield Farms in New York, finished with Bordelaise sauce & shallots, buttery mashed Yukon Golds, and vibrant green sauteed spinach; definitely worth a trip to downtown Bethesda. They also have chicken, halibut, salmon, to name a few. The Moroccan Couscous dish is a must for first timers! Our meal started off with soup; I had the Charred Tomato & Tortilla Soup ($5.95) and Hubby had the Wild Mushroom & Leek Soup with a Chevre Crostinia must to compliment this flavorful soup! ($5.95) I'd had the mushroom soup before, and my memory was still intact and they still made it as delicious as years ago! These are the only two selections for soupafter you've tasted them, you'll realize it's more than enough. Our entrees: the Brazilian Shellfish Stew in a spicy Tomato-Coconut Curry Sauce with Basmati Rice and Fried Plantain Strips as garnish ($19.95). Spectacular! The shrimp, mussels, salmon, scallops (these depend on what is fresh and available) were tender and not overpowered by the sauce, in fact the natural flavors of each were brought out by the clean', fresh broth, and contributed to complexity of the entire dish. Kudos to the Chef! I had the Pistachio-Crusted Tuna on a Bed of Garlic Sauteed Spinach and Crowned with Fresh Watercress ($19.95). To die for! I have a bias for tuna, and this tops my list. I asked for medium rare, and it created a perfectly seared border around the pinkish flesh. No starch for this dish and rightly so! Some negatives: Service through the meal was at best mediocre, not as attentive as we would have liked. I also have to mention that their restrooms are not kept well. Be wary of their version of Pad Thai and Quesadillasnot their best. Price is on the expensive side so save this for something special. Overall, the experience was gastronomic bliss, thus making us forget the rude host in front. I would definitely visit this quaint cafe again and again and again!"

Text = "After dining here a few times I ordered food to go. When I got home, I discovered that the portions were extremely small (not even enough for one person). For example, one of the 6 enters was a stir-fried chicken with broccoli, for $7.95. It had 6 pieces of broccoli and 4 pieces of chicken. Since I had eaten there before and not had this problem I thought there had been a mistake. So I called the owner, he was very apologetic on the phone and asked me to come back over and he would fix the situation. I thought this was a nice gesture, however, when I arrived a man who I believe was the cook brought out a serving of one of the entrees that I had ordered threw it on the table and said, "Do you think this is enough for you". From there he was extremely rude, and accused me of just wanting a free meal (my bill was $59, definitely not free). The owner said nothing the entire time, except " we have been here for 6 months and nothing has ever been said before". I never did figure out why the owner asked me to come back. Suffice it to say I wouldn't recommend going there to anyone, and if you do, beware of the cook in the back."

I had the two pound lobster and Carmen had the peel and eat shrimp our bill camne the 565 pesos or 62.78 with the tip in US dlls. When going to Mexico I go for the great bargains which were hard to come by while dining at the Shrimp Factory..Can You say tourist trap?"

Text = "Reservations are almost always required to get a spot on a Friday or Saturday evening. Always seated in a timely manner if arriving at reservation time. Initial greeting by server usually takes a bit longer than I'd prefer and it seems to be that way most times I go. It's hard to say whether or not the "long" wait times for server and food are intentional so their patrons do not feel rushed in any way. It is a BYOB establishment and I usually bring a bottle of wine that the waitstaff tends to promptly. Food is excellent but takes a while longer to receive than most places. Pricing is a bit on the expensive side but I'd say the food and experience are definitely worth it. The only thing they could do to improve my visits could be to speed up service and food delivery just a bit. Overall, it's a hard place to beat for an authentic cajun meal in a quaint, new orleans, mardi gras(ish) environment. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone interested in a quiet, REAL, cajun dinner."

Moreover, she showed a distinct lack of familiarity with the menu and with server responsibilities. An appetizer had to be explained to her; she brought a beer with no glass to the table. Most importantly, it took much too long to be served. One person at our table had an appetizer. The salads that were served after it came 75 minutes after we'd sat down. A party of two that had arrived when we did had finished their meal and left before we were served our main courses. In any restaurant, the food can be excellent, but if the service suffers, it simply won't taste as good."

They claim their time-honored traditions have not changed at all since it opened and use only the finest ingredients in everything they make. I have been to so many restaurants that say the same thing but miss the mark However; I believe what they say I applaud the Millbrae Pancake House for keeping with tradition! If you are in the mood for an above average breakfast and you in the Millbrae area then you gotta try the Millbrae Pancake House...Forget Ihop, the Pancake House has buttermilk pancakes will literally melt in your mouth! The Millbrae Pancake house is approximately 3 miles from the San Francisco Airport so it's convenient from most Airport hotels.

My food was less then fair and who serves carrots with sweet potato?? Orange must be in this season. Not to mention I found it very unnerving to have the hostess prowling the floor every 5 seconds making feel like I wasn't eating fast enough.

Restaurant had an overal grungy appearance Dishes and glasses are chipped, scratched and dirty looking. Food was obviously re-heated and had no flavor. I returned my meal to the server and he didn't seemed surprised to be getting it back. I would not suggest this place to anyone. We ate at the Farmhouse (they have 2 dining areas- I am not sure what they call the other one). I ordered the chicken pot pie, which I returned and the waiter removed from the bill. It was warm, but had a congealed consistency and the crust was very rubbery. Just an all around unpleasant looking and tasting item. Food should look good, smell good, taste good and even feel good in your mouth - this did none of those things. My husband ordered the prime rib - gray in color and sitting in a puddle of what looked like water. His dinner came with a little cup of what I guess was suppose to be aus jus, but honestly was clear grease with some brown globs in the bottom. It did not smell good either. He did eat about 1/2 of what I would term as the edible part of the piece he was served. The vegetable soup was the only item that was good - tasted like it always has. As for the restaurant's atmosphere, it was basically grungy. The table had not been wiped off and there were crumbs and glass rings visible. The clear drinking glasses are so scratched and worn they have a beige color to them and the dishes are not in much better shape - lots of spidery cracks and chips."

Text = "The Coral Grill has been a landmark of the Florida Key's since the early 60's, known for it's huge, fresh and bountiful seafood buffet; it was very popular with locals and vacationers alike. Over the years the management / owners had switched hands several times and unfortunately every time there was a changing of the guard the quality of the food and service suffered. The Coral Grill was untimely the final owners drove the restaurant to the ground which lead to the closing of it's doors. For several years one would drive by and see the huge "Coral Grill" sign wishing that it would re-open. Then unexpectedly there was activity within the building and to our surprise the restaurant re-opened with a fourth installment of new management. We had hoped that the extended years of hibernation of the Coral Grill meant that perhaps someone who remember what the Coral Grill used to be famous for and perhaps would once again bring this "world famous" restaurant back to it's original grandeur. We decided to give her a try Unfortunately the Coral Grill is only but a miniscule representation of it's former self. Yes, the buffet is back but in a very, very small scale. The upstairs dinning room is still closed and the limited buffet is now in a room where "lunch" used to be served. Very depressing for those who used to wait an hour or more for a table to be rewarded for waiting by mountains of fresh seafood, mouth watering prime rib and a desert selection to die for. There were no lines and we got a seat immediately, which should have been a warning of what was to come. A rather attractive blond haired woman served us, however her attitude and customer service skills needed some major improvement. She acted as if we were bothering her, even more surprising when we noticed that the dining room was filled to about a fourth of it's capacity. The food, although of very limited quantity, was not bad. The prime rib was very tasty and the crab legs appeared fresh. Other items seemed picked over; the soups were watery and needed some more seasoning. Crab cakes, one of their specialties of days old, were not even close to what we remember. Salad bar was out of greens and the desert bar was populated with small pieces of some cake like substance, jello and what looked like ambrosia salad. If the price was about half of what we paid, I would have considered the meal almost expectable. But for what the Coral Grill is currently charging per person, there are far better seafood buffets, one of them is right across the street at the Whale Harbor Inn. It's a shame that the new owners seemed to think that people will flock to the restaurant based on it's name alone. What they failed to realize that people remember the food, the quantity and the quality, that's what brings them back. From the empty dinning room it's easy to understand that many people in the Florida Keys are aware that the days of the old Coral Grill are long gone."

The wait was nominal, and the hostes kept up appraised of our seating availability. We were seated in a wonderful booth toward the N/E corner of the restaurant. Immediately our drink order was taken and served. Then Tiffany, our waitress explained the family style menu, made some suggestions as to selections and was off w/ our order. In a very reasonable amount of time, our order was served, HOT, and quite plentiful for a Lunch menu. Several times Tiffany returned to check on our satisfaction. We could not have been happier. Part of customer treatment, is determined by the tone set by the customer. We found the Iron Wok to be a GREAT dining experience and would highly recommend it to everyone."

He informed us that the restaurant was "...not a cafeteria. You people are not spending enough money and we have a line of other customers, so you need to leave..." When we could speak again, we complained to a waiter/busboy who came by our table about not having an opportunity to place another order. He said, "you do not have to leave." But after he left, the first man returned and continued to berate us for not having made it worth while to have seated us. He reiterated that the restaurant was not a cafeteria, and held fast to his demand that we leave. This, despite our explanation that we had not even been given the opportunity to place an order for more food and continue with our meal. To add insult to injury, we then had to wait an additional ten minutes for someone to bring us the change for our check. We were finally whisked out the front door, with waiters clearing the table before our coats were on. A thoroughly humiliating experience."

I sent the meal back only to wait another 1/2 hour for it to return. In the meantime my friends had finished their lunches. One had the Portabello sandwich, good. The other had a chicken pasta, chicken overcooked. We had two waiters (one was the owner I believe, he never so much as said boo to us, the other only grunted in our direction), neither one barely acknowledged us. Our water was never replenished and we were never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. I ended up having my salmon wrapped to take home (which took another 15 minutes). In my previous life before having my son I traveled with my job and have eaten at many, many excellent restaurants across the country. I can without a doubt say, 227 Bistro had the worst service I have ever experienced. It is really too bad, the place has an exceptional atmosphere. The staff, however, could care less that you are there! I can't imagine this establishment surviving on their looks alone. What a disappointment!"

A pasta dish was served (Alfredo) with a very bitter taste, I do know alfredo and this was awful. Almost non-existant service, and sub standard food. Wine was good but over priced."

Text = "The neighborhood has watched with great interest for some months as this building was completely gutted and refurbished in preparation for the opening of this restaurant. I wish I could say it had been worth the wait. The renovated space is beautiful - spare, modern, elegant. The front patio was quite warm on the cold night we visited, and the pianist inside, though barely audible on the patio, is a nice touch. The service, while friendly and cordial (perhaps overly so, but the new kid tries harder) was abysmal. Our waiter appeared only occasionally, and the tables nearby did quite a bit of neck-craning as well. The server's scarceness seemed even more annoying in view of the glacial slowness with which our courses appeared. This is definitely not a restaurant to visit if you have theater tickets (unless you enjoy missing, at the very least, the first act). The food? We started with the ahi tartare, but the server brought us the cherry tomato/basil/olive tartlets instead. My fellow diner enjoyed them (I hate tomatoes, but they were comped). The ahi, when it finally arrived, was delicious, as was the clam chowder that eventually followed. I chose the paella as my main course; my companion had the monkfish. His was okay, I guess (he ate it all), but the paella was positively dismal. The rice was grainy, chalky even, and scorched as well. Uneatable. It was just as well, I guess; the long interval between the chowder and the entree had killed my appetite. So, bottom line. The renovation was worth the wait, but you'll want to give these folks a few months to get service, timing and food under control. If you enjoy being a guinea pig, though, this is the restaurant for you!"

Text = "Had the Barbeque grilled chicken on a bed of smashed potatoes with a salad. Chicken- AWESOME, juicy, tender, very flavorful. Mashed Potatoes- excellent, creamy, soft salads are very good Apple Cobbler desert is decent Texas Spring Rolls appetizer only bad experience, short on flavor and too greasy. Service was good."
