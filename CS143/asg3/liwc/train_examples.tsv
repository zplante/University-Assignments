5	pos	train	Food EXCELLENT, Every Chance we get we eat there. Get there early, Always crowded
5	pos	train	My landlord's family actually owns this restaurant. Their food comes so close to my grandmother's cooking---and the meatballs are heavenly!! I also loved their homemade salad dressing-italian of course--just like from when I was little at gramma's house!! This is a definate comfort food place for everyone!
5	pos	train	EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!!
5	pos	train	Buckey's is a great little place with really good food, they have awesome Pizza and they have daily specials. The service is Great! and they have a pheonomal Onion Brick for an appetiser I highly recommend this if your in the area
5	pos	train	The chefs are very nice and the service is great! Their prices are very reasonable and even the other diners were very nice and polite.
5	pos	train	My family and I had a wonderful evening. Our dining experience was made quite easy with the experienced and knowledgable staff. The wait for the food was short and the taste delectable. I will surely be returning for many more dinners.
5	pos	train	Wonderfully aged beef and fish that is flown in daily. The service and atmosphere superb, low lighting with burning fireplaces and a very cozy lounge as well. Highly recommended!
5	pos	train	Very good selection of Mexican foods. We had enchiladas mole, chimichangas, chilis rellenos, and flan for dessert. Plenty of food, prices were reasonable. We'll definitely go back.
5	pos	train	Fine dining establishment right on the beach perfect to catch a Hawaiian sunset. Not a bad seat in the house. Excellent fresh seafood and well prepared steaks. A little pricy but well worth a special occasion like a trip to Kauai, Hawaii.
5	pos	train	Crickets is always a pleasure. We have been there several times. The service is always exceptional and the food is consistently good. They have an extensive beer list and wine list. The bar area can be a little noisy, but the food and the service more than make up for it. We last dined there on a Saturday night and only waited for 25 minutes. Prices are reasonable for the quality, although specials can be a bit pricey.
5	pos	train	"Rodizio Grill is probably the best place I have ever eaten. It is styled after a Brazilian ""barbecue."" If you love meat and can eat a lot, this is the place. There are all kinds of meats and salads, and it is all you can eat. The waiters walk around with the meat on spear-type things and they cut you off the slice you want. The food is incredible and the service is great. Plan on going about an hour and a half before you want to eat, though, as they don't take reservations and dinner time is always full (at least on the weekends). There is plenty to do in the shopping area as you wait, though. It is well worth it! There is also a Rodizio Grill and another similar restaurant called Tucano's in Orem, UT, if you are in that area."
5	pos	train	Chardonnay presents fine cuisine in a warmly lit atmosphere. Greeted and seated quickly after the valet parked the car, the server reminded us to order a souffle for dessert when we ordered our meal. The melange of vegetables that came with our meals was excellent. Two of us had Dover sole, which melted in our mouths! Others had the rack of lamb, which was wonderful. The chocolate souffles for dessert hit the spot.
5	pos	train	I have been going to malek's for 8 years, they know my entire family. A wastress who came back to work there, said I remember you you have been coming here for a long time, its nice to see you. I love their food, we go there every weekend no if's and's or but's, its so good right now i'm going to be ordering a salad, the grilled chicken salad is to so good. My father has been getting the grilled chicken sub for years now and loves every bite. Everyone there is really nice, you should try there food if you live around springfield or near it :)
5	pos	train	Excellent food with a fairly impressive menu. The service is also very good. Atmosphere is typical.
5	pos	train	Delightful downtown dining, that is what Basserie Las Olas is all about. This casual restaurant sits in the canyons of downtown Ft. Lauderdale, and day or night the passing parade on the Boulevard can be observed from the streetside tables. The menu is a creative mix of familiar foods and original creations by chef Jerry Leskody often combing flavors which aren't normally seen together like the crab, spinach, and artichoke dip appetizer ($8.50), or the escargot ravioli ($8). One of the more popular appetizers is the Tuscan Peppercorn Crusted Tuna Carpaccio with bermuda onion, basil, capers, chives, Reggiano Parmesan and balsamic glace ($9.50). Salads are hearty and flavorful and include a Caesar which you can get with grilled chicken breast, grilled fresh salmon, grilled shrimp, or grilled steak, which make them salad meals, a classic Cobb salad ($9.50), or a Grilled Salmon Nicoise ($13). There is also a tasty house salad ($5). Soups include the always favorite Onion Soup ($6) and a Winter Vegetable Minestrone with mushroom tortelli ($5) Although the list of entrees is extensive and offers all sorts of chicken, fish, and meat, my own particular favorite is the Filet Mignon ($25). This hunk of aged beef is grilled to perfection and served with steamed broccoli and fried potatoes. though I recommend asking for a substitution of the garlic mashed potatoes which go well with the rich brown sauce served with the steak. My wife's personal favorite is the Jambalaya served with a rich blend of seafood and shellfish. Other great menu items include the Crispy Half Duck served with confit and sauce cassis, wild rice pilaf and fresh steamed veggies ($18) and the Lobster Pot Pie made with chunks of lobster and mushrooms in a rich sherry cream sauce. Topped with a Mashed Potato Crust ($16). Also the Angel Hair Pasta with Jumbo Gulf Shrimp with a touch of white wine ($17) is delicious. Service is excellent and attentive and the servers are well versed on the daily specials as well as the regular menu items. The decor is modern, dress is casual. There is valet parking ($5) which is recommended.
5	pos	train	If you are planning to visit any Claim Jumper May I suggest one thing, bring your appetite. The menu so vast and the food so plentiful I promise you will leave with a doggie box because you won't be able to fit what left over in a bag. The food has always been above average along with the service. However I do believe they should open another Claim Jumper in another section of town because on busy nights the wait to be seated can last as long as one to two hours, while waiting to get seated try snuggling up to the full service bar that caters to the family and offers great Hor'devours but I must warn you the appetizers can be so filling you won't have room for dinner. I must say Claim Jumper is by far one of my most favorite restaurants of all times!
5	pos	train	"As a Southerner living in Vermont I could not wait to sample the BBQ at Finkerman's. And now, having done so, I cannot wait to go back. My boyfriend and I made the quick trip from Burlington to Montpelier on a Sunday. We had no trouble being seated and were immediately pleased with the atmosphere. I have read other complaints about the noise but, as it was not crowded, this was not an issue for us. I definitly think the atmosphere will improve with age- I am used to and prefer a more ""rustic"" setting for BBQ. As far as it not being a ""romantic"" atmosphere (a few reviewers commented on this), when has BBQ ever been romantic. Regardless of where one consumes ribs, I find nothing attractive about a sauce smothered face and hands. (On second thought...) Over all our meal was great. I had the plate of pulled pork, which I will have again when I return. My boyfriend had the ribs, which I sampled, and loved them. I am not really a fan in general but was impressed with the amount of meat each peice had. As for the sides, the cornbread was good but a little too dry. The fries were excellent- perfect amount of salt. The jalapeno cheese grits could of used more cheese but considering grits are about as common in Vermont as a snowless winter, I was happy. The candied sweet potatoes were also good but I think next time I'll with the greens route. I definitly plan on returning to Finkerman's and only hope the ""want"" for BBQ in this area will stick around. I would hate to see a restaurant like this close its doors."
5	pos	train	I stopped by Two Rivers to celebrate my sisters engagement on Valentines Day. The staff was friendly and helpful. We enjoyed a champagne toast and heart shapped ravioli for the holiday. I didn't have dessert but everyone else raved about the carrot cake. The restaurant has a friendly neighborhood feel to it as the staff greated most of patrons by name. We had a great time and will return.
5	pos	train	Best country fried steak!
5	pos	train	Very good chinese food for Fairfield County. We enjoyed our meals very much, especially General Tsou's Chicken and the Chilean Sea Bass in black bean sauce. Great wine selection and very good service. We will return for sure!
5	pos	train	The best Mexican food I've tasted in a long time!! Very fresh, very authentic and very reasonable!!! I highly recommend it !!
5	pos	train	Great food. We went at a slow time so I think we got extra attention. Good prices. We shared the blackened chicken, crab cakes, and vodoo crawfish, everything was excellent. I will definitely go again.
5	pos	train	Great as always. I'm systematically going through the menu and have yet to find something that isn't good. Kudos to the Cuban Mojo and Carribean Dip. Steak is good, but not as flamingoish as other dishes. Try a scone, even if you haven't liked them in the past. Servers are great for a table of 2 or a table of 10.
5	pos	train	We tried this restaurant based on the previous review, very encouraging. Also some friends of ours mentioned it as the place where they usually go when they want to eat meat. So there we went today. As a starter, we had a Soup du Jour made of crab, shrimp, clam - out of this world! I then had a Big Willy sandwich and my wife a pork sandwich. The meat was exquisite, the hot sauce was tasty, the portions generous, and the service very friendly...... We'll definitly go again!...
5	pos	train	Strange to find a great steak in a seafood restaurant, but if the seafood is as good as the steak was, it must be extraordinary. The caesar salad was almost as good as Hotel Roanoke's caesar salad. Almost as good because the taste was as good but the lettuce was a bit wilted with few crisp pieces.
5	pos	train	If you are interested in a good Dungeness Crab Sandwich go to Fisherman's Wharf, but, if you are looking for an great Dungeness Crab Sandwich, then you should head to Pacifica, to an ocean front restaurant called Nick's, just off scenic Highway One, 15 minutes south of San Francisco. Nick's offers spectacular ocean views from almost every seat and during the winter, you can enjoy the sight and sound of the monster waves crashing against the rocks from the comfort of your table. Nicks has been a staple of Rockaway Beach in Pacifica, since 1927, it has been owned and operated by the Gust family since its inception. Nick's offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus, has a full service bar and caters banquets. Oh yes, I almost forgot, if you drink too much while at the bar, no problem, you can crash at the Sea Breeze Motel also owned by the Gusts, it's located next door, the Sea Breeze, also offers incredible ocean views. Nick' is open seven days a week and has ample parking.
5	pos	train	You never leave hungry. Their portions are XXXL. More than a normal person can eat. Highly recommend this restaurant. It is a family dining establishment. No liquor. 600 Block of Derby St. in Pekin, Illinois.
5	pos	train	"Gran Sabana Restaurant features Puerto Rican, Cuban and Caribbean foods for Lunch and Dinner. This family-owned-and-operated establishment brings a new cuisine to the Triangle. The Puerto Rican and Cuban Cuisines are among the most flavorful in the world, they have their roots in the Spanish, African, and Taino Indian cooking. The diverse combination of cooking styles yield unique flavors. They are amazingly tasty, earthy, compelling, heck pick your superlative. They pretty much all work. We are so pleased to tell you that the Triangle Area finally has a Puerto Rican and Cuban restaurant. It's called Gran Sabana and its located at 4853 Hwy 55 at the Intersection with Hwy 54  Exit 278 of I-40, not far from from the South Point Mall in Durham, North Carolina. The food at Gran Sabana is lip smacking good. Every meal is made fresh and that fresh food alone will get you in the door, but their excellent, friendly service will keep you coming back for more. The Yuca frita is sensational. They take chunks of yucca root, boil and then deep fry it and serve it with a Mojo [Garlic/Cilantro Dip]. The texture is firm, Crispy, but not chewey. The Tostones, plantains cut into disks, deep fried, and served with more Mojo is real tasty. The main dishes are diverse and awash in a sea of history and tradition. Consider the Ropa Vieja. And how about the show stopper, the Pernil or Lechon Asado [Roast Pork]. Cooked for 7 hours until it literally falls apart, this dish defies description. Tender, astonishingly flavorful, it is a wonder to taste. And for dessert, try the home made ""Flan"" [Spanish Custard] or the ""Tres Leches"". A cake made using condensed, evaporated and whole milks topped with a whipped cream it is absolutely to die for. The cake is moist because the milks are poured over it as it comes from out of the oven. Served cold, it was sensational. Visit them soon and see what they have waiting for you. Award-Winning Food All of these homemade meals are delicious and made from scratch. Gran Sabana has received recognition for their great tasting Lunch and Dinner foods on several occasions. When you come by, try the lunch special  a complete meal featuring Meat, Rice, Beans and Plantains. Banquets and Catering Can seat 90+ persons comfortably for lunch, or dinner meetings or celebrations. Many have already hosted events at Gran Sabana such as banquets, parties, company parties, clubs, and churches. Their catering services offer an entire menu for lunch, or dinner to the surrounding cities."
5	pos	train	2 Rivers is the gem of lower Manhattan. This little American bistro offers a pleasant atmosphere with delicious cuisine that is surprisingly inexpensive. It's a great lunch place with a decent happy hour crowd. They offer a brunch on Sunday that is to die for. In addition to this, they might have the best burger in lower Manhattan - which is saying quite a bit! I'll definitely go back.
5	pos	train	Greatest hibachi grill I've ever been to.
5	pos	train	"An overwhelmingly pleasant experience. We invited family from out of town to join us. My brother stated after dinner that he would drive the 80 miles to come again. We were pleased with every aspect of the dining experience. The food portions are beyond description. The taste and quality of the ingredients are second to none. And the friendly staff makes you feel your at ""Mama Roberto's"" dining room table. If you haven't tried it, please do so. You won't be disappointed."
5	pos	train	wonderful food, wonderful service
5	pos	train	My husband and were visiting Vancouver and we happened across this restaurant while walking along Coal Harbour. This has to be the best patio in the city. The food and service were wonderful. We would definately return!
5	pos	train	In a little cottage nestled on Rose Street in downtowm Pleasanton is a gem of a find. Country French decore and welcoming hosts. Claude is the chef and offers a wide variety daily of French country cooking prepared lovingly and with great expertise. The fare ranges from the peasant stew of rabbit and fresh vegetables wonderfuly seasoned, to escargot, to beef in pastry shell with pate. Whatever you choose your experience will be memorable. Dominique treats you as if you were an honored guest in her home. The prices are moderate to high, but the value is definately there! Reservations are a must! The wine menu is small but offers a good selection, and the desserts are excellent. Don't miss this one!
5	pos	train	This bar has the friendliest people and they have the best mussels you will ever eat. I recommend the crab bread also its just a great place.
5	pos	train	Best value for the $$. You can't beat all you can eat shellfish.
5	pos	train	Thought the food was excellent. A previous reviewer said the food was bland, but obviously they don't know that Pa dutch and Amish food is supposed to be bland.I wouldn't even say it is bland, just simple and old fashioned. I grew up with this cooking and found it almost as good as my grandmothers. Very large selection to choose from. One person in our party is even a vegetarian and she left full. We will return again as soon as we get out that way!
5	pos	train	Upon hearing it was our first visit, the head chef came out and welcomed us to the restraint and gave us a complementary shrimp cocktail (yummy). The only mix-up was on the drinks but they were nice. The Arnold Palmer was very tart and required much sugar to tone it down. The Prime Rib and Teriyaki Steaks were perfect. The Mocha Cake desert was the best< I have ever had. The kitchen noise was a bit much as it is exposed to the diners. Basically, the room could sure use some sound deadening material as it is comprised of mostly woods, metals and glass. We truly enjoyed the experience and will return but will ask for a booth away from the kitchen noise.
5	pos	train	Atomic Cafe is so unique for Lexington! The restaurant is all about the patio! (Especially with our new smoking ban.) The food is always excellent and the presentation is nice too. Add excellent tropical drinks and live bands on the weekends and you have my favorite spot in town!
5	pos	train	They had an 8oz. Sizzler Dinner with salad, wild rice and california vegetables on special for $11.75. They had house wine (Crow Canyon) for $4.50 a glass or $12 per bottle. The salad was crisp, the meat cooked and seasoned superbly, and the wine was smooth. I got much more than I was expecting at a hotel bar!
5	pos	train	This is the best restaurant in the Metrowest part of Boston. It is the best kept secret and is a real dinning experence. Fava is much better than the better known resturants in the Metrowest area.
5	pos	train	"Absolutely fantastic! Not only is the food delish, but the portions are tremendous. The attention to detail to make this place truly ""New York style"" is wonderful."
5	pos	train	This area is filled with run of the mill chains. This restaurant is so unique! one of a kind with truly superior food and service than anything in the area.
5	pos	train	This is by far the best thai food I have had in all the thai resturants in all of San Diego county. Excellent!! It is a very small resturant located in the Hilltop area of San Diego.
5	pos	train	Very good food! Loved the potato scramble thing and that smoothy asai (spelling?) bowl. Sad that it burnt down. :-( Note from We8there.com: Cafe Brasil re-opened 11/07/04 
5	pos	train	"This is by far a hidden gem. On the outskirts of the little city of Decatur, quite unassuming yet decorative, sits a veritable Diamond in the Rough. In a cafe-like atmosphere,a laid-back artsy type waiter serves you with attentiveness and flair. You can even mosey over and shop while you wait in their Candle, Soap, potion/notions, & cards area. Smells of honey and ginger intoxicate your senses and entice you into a calm before eating. They save the best, in my opinion, for last..they have on the menu, ""Very Good Chocolate Cake""...that's an understatement! In all my travels, fine dining and every level in between .. that was by far the ""Best slice of chocolate cake you'll ever eat"". You'll always go back for the cake served up with a dollop of fresh whipped cream to smear it in..HEAVENLY"
5	pos	train	From the delicious bread/fabulous pastries at the bakery, to their warm staff Pacific Way is one of the best kept secrets on the Oregon Coast! I would recommend the cafe to anyone looking for a good meal.
5	pos	train	My wife had the wine. She enjoyed it very much. She had seafood, but wished she had tried their lobster & steak special. (It was a great price!) I was on a different quest...looking for the best French onion soup I could find. I found the 2nd best I have ever experienced at this restaurant. If you visit this place, don't miss it!
5	pos	train	My friend Michele took her roommate Lara and I to Teaspace and I LOVED it. I am in town from Las Vegas and have to say this place is one of my faves now. I had the shrimp green curry with black rice and jasmine rice (half and half), edamame, unfiltered pearl sake and for dessert, the kaffir lime pie with strawberry sauce. I would love to go again before I leave Atlanta. WIll def. come back when I return. BTW the unfiltered pearl sake is the only sake I have ever liked. I recommend it!
5	pos	train	Wonderful staff, very helpful. Best Thai food in Atlanta. Highly recommend reservations.
5	pos	train	I love this place! The point of Rain Forest is the cool atmosphere, complete with thunder and lightening! The pot roast is great, the rasta pasta is my favorite! The servings are HUGE and there is plenty of cool drinks in souviner glasses. I like this place so much I have also taken guests to the one at Sawgrass Mills Mall in Ft. Lauderdale (Sunrise). It is a tourist spot so I would avoid Fri and Sat night if you are a local, and go early. The one out at Disney shopping is the coolest location because the huge valcano outside and they used to do live bird shows on the sidewalk in the afternoons. I would call first to see if they still do that. This place is fun and the gift shop is fun to look at if you have to wait for a table. I have never waited more than 45 min at dinner and I have never waited more than 10 min for lunch at all. Service has always been perfect and the bathrooms have always been clean...a real plus in my book here in Florida!
5	pos	train	My friends and I went to Table Talk last weekend after they got that write-up in Washingtonian. We were NOT disappointed!!! Although we had to wait 5 minutes for a parking space, the cheerful hostess sat us right away, (party of 6 on a Sunday morning - the place was packed, but service was very quick) and our experience was even more enhanced by the food. Serious comfort food!!!!!
5	pos	train	Italian Opera singing servers, great food and a worldly dinning experience. Also African Caribbean Night At Venuto's World Bistro Chef Soliel is a wonderful exotic cook with personality. Frequenly comes out to the dinning room to dance or play the drums. Enjoy a unique dinning experience Afican-Caribibean
5	pos	train	"All I can say is ""Home Cooking at it's best"", Fresh baked bread and the portions were so big."
5	pos	train	I frequently go to Panda North. It's my favorite restaurant. The food is exquisite, and well as the service and setting. I have been to Panda with just about all my close friends and family. Every single person whom I've gone with loves it too. So if you're in the area, or even if your not I highly suggest that you eat they're wonderfully prepared Chinese Food. It'll be worth the trip. I guarantee it!
5	pos	train	Was met by Bob who was very pleasent and very helpful. The food was great. I will be returning.
5	pos	train	Meraviglioso, wonderful
5	pos	train	I liked Macaroni Grill because it has very good food. The service was so nice. The atmosphere was the best. Price/ Value wasn't that much. The best thing after the atmosphere was that you didn't have to make a reservation so you could just come in and get seated. I would want to go back to Macaroni Grill.
5	pos	train	Great place to get a lobster roll.
5	pos	train	Great Ribs, Meat fell of the bones. Reasonabily priced and good service. Also is a catering place.
5	pos	train	Features French Continental cuisine. Has a wide range of beef, fish, chicken, and pasta selections. The escargots a La Bourguignone was truly outstanding. Served in puff pastry with an exceptional sauce. The beef tenderloin was cooked to perfection and very tender. Servers were continually aware of the status of the table but did not intrude. Wine selections are extensive but pricey. Suggest ordering by the glass.
5	pos	train	Have dined at Dresslers about 8-12 times. It is close to home and have not been dissapointed yet. Will keep going!!
5	pos	train	Warm cozy decor, friendly hosts, outstanding service, outstanding food!!!!!!!,food arrives at your table HOT, can you imagine???? My only complaint is that I can't get past the specials of the day to try the regular menu!!!! You won't be sorry, whatever you order. Treat yourself to the best Italian food on Long Island!!!!!
5	pos	train	One of my favorite restaurants in the world. It is a fantastic place with HUGE sandwiches. We have eaten there several times when on vacations. One of which was Easter- on that day they had a buffet that was delicious. We have made a habit of stopping there on the way to the airport to get sandwiches to go!
5	pos	train	The food is delicious and the service is great. The restaurant does not have a liquor license but gladly allows you to bring whatever you want. Hibachi is food and entertainment combined, while sushi is very fresh and has a lot of variety.
5	pos	train	The atmosphere, which included a 'bluesy' surrounding with plenty of candle light was relaxing and warm. The menu includes rib and pepper steak, to name a few, and a lot of Mediterranean type meals. Even the dinner salad seems gourmet! It is adjacent to a secluded bar 5 miles outside of Fairbanks on the Parks Highway. I highly recommend it.
5	pos	train	I can't really add much to the previous reviews, except to add that there are two additional locations for this great casual restaurant. The original place is in Woonsocket, RI, and their newest location is on Route 1 in South Attletboro, about two miles north of Emerald Square Mall. There are daily specials on weeknights, to lure you out of your own kitchen. Great food, great prices, great variety!
5	pos	train	This is one of the only German restaurants in San Francisco and brings back memories of many meals enjoyed in Germany. If you're looking for outstanding German traditional dishes, this is the place to go. Diners can also select from an extensive beer menu and the staff is always willing to make a great recommendation. They are busy most evenings, but the wait is definitely worthwhile. The decor is very understated, but very similar to the pubs in smaller German towns. It can be a little loud at times, so don't plan on this being the most romantic restaurant. If you're looking for a real treat, try the venison!
5	pos	train	We were greeted with enthusiasm and the food was fantastic. I was not completely familiar wth cajun food so I asked quite a bit of questions. All were answered thouroughly and with excitement. The food was served with a wide variety of sauces from mild to scorned woman hot souce! Woo Baby! That stuff is great! It's a very casual place and the kids absolutely love it.
5	pos	train	All you can eat pizza buffet for $2.99 per person, drinks about a dollar extra. 3 and under are free. They make any pizza you like, even with anchovies, and will deliver desired any amount of desired pizza to your table if you want. They are upbeat and we love to eat there.
5	pos	train	We enjoyed our meal enormously. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. I will return again and will definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends.
5	pos	train	Our party had heard good things about this new spot, so we tried them out on Thursday evening. We were looking for a moderate meal with a little wine and nothing too fussy. What we got exceeded expectations so much so that we stayed longer and spent much more money than we had intended. Our waiter was a real pro--engaging, witty and really sexy. The owner herself stopped by our table frequently to make conversation which added to our feeling of welcome. The music they were playing set a great mood and the room is elegant and sophisticated. The combination of flavours and thoughtfulness that has obviously gone into the Chef's menu makes the food here a bargain at twice the price. His portion sizes are enourmous. Finally, there was a super mix of gay and straight--absent any Yaletown preening, posturing or pretentious.
5	pos	train	This Applebee's is probably the best one that I have ever been to. The service is always top-notch, the food is good tasting and quick-to-arrive, and the prices are very reasonable. They also have special promotions that are run. I deffinately recomend it.
5	pos	train	"This was a fine place! We did not make reservations; however, I would recommend doing so. We were lucky they had an empty table. I had clam chowder. It was fantastic! One of my co-workers thought it was a bit ""peppery"", but I enjoyed it! Everyone loved their choices from the menu. I thought it was a bit pricey, but the rest of the experience made up for the cost."
5	pos	train	What a pleasant evening in Chicago! I ordered the 16 Oz Prime Rib which was delicious!! I couldn't even eat it all. The baked potato was awesome too. Staff is really friendly! Would return!
5	pos	train	Absolutely wonderful!!! The atmosphere was of a beautiful log cabin with a pianist playing soft background music. The meal was terrific. Highly recommend!!!
5	pos	train	"Rodizio was one of the best dining experiences we ever had. I scouted the restaurant reviews before our visit to Salt Lake; they were positive. We were not disappointed. We even returned for lunch two days later. Their signature all-you-can-eat buffet, with grilled meat and vegetables served tableside off of skewers, is pricey for dinner but reasonable for lunch. Grilled meat was ham, beef, turkey (or chicken, I forget) and vegetables. Lamb would have have been great too, but they didn't have it. Perhaps it's because the word ""lamb"" could have political ramifications, even though Americans really serve muton. I understand, if you want the 15% discount, you need to be an LDS missionary."
5	pos	train	It was wonderful. I didnt know Columbia, SC had something that nice
5	pos	train	Chef John Ross' the pioneer of using fresh local cuisine and the first Chef to put Long Island wines on his award winning lists has a wonderful take out spot in the middle of the north fork beaches and wine country on Long island.He serves smoked duck legs,fall off the bone ribs,fresh battered fish fry on Friday nights,chowders and the best rotisserie chicken packed to go. He serves turduckins for the holiday season. Home made rice pudding!! the best you will find. Creamed spinach and other veggie delights too. Bring your own wine!
5	pos	train	Having a choice between 64 wines by the glass blew me away. And the huge wine bottle list offered wines from all over the world and a magnificent champagne list as well. The wine list was over 20 pages! The food was well-balanced and heavenly. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to impress.
5	pos	train	A taste of China in Greenwich, CT. For over 20 years Hunan Gourmet has been pleasing clients with exceptional service and pleasing their taste buds with a variety of foods that share one thing in common - Taste! Every attention to detail is given to the food and service at this Greenwich gem.
5	pos	train	The restaurant was wonderful! The food choices were unique and very well-prepared. Everything was great! What a fabulous place for dinner for two or with friends!
5	pos	train	The food is one of the best I've ever had. The service is great, and the food is ready quickly. They also have great mango juices.
5	pos	train	Very nice, was surprised at the menu. Didn't know they could do so many things with a Pizza! Loved the chicken with the white sauce, would come back for that alone. I really enjoyed the visit. Thanks for coming to DuPont, we needed a good restaurant.
5	pos	train	Authentic Mexican (which is very hard to find) in suburban Philly. Very easy to get to from 476 and 676. I highly recommmend the tampica. The atmosphere is relaxing and romantic if you decided to dine outside. Very nice presentation. For more info, go to www.coyotecrossing.com.
5	pos	train	Owner, bartender, waitstaff, and desert chef all made a point of checking in on our meals/drinks and advising us on selections. We sampled wines to be paired with our entrees, received personal recommendations from the chef from the menu. After our meal, the kitchen staff then directed us to a great local bar. This was a prime example of a hidden--but not buried--treasure. Do not miss it!
5	pos	train	Have had many wonderful dinners at Charlestons, never a bad dinner or service,,, sometimes a little loud. Recommend filet and the garlic mashed potatoes....
5	pos	train	The Flat Rock Grille is a spectacular place to dine. When I go to dine I am always amazed at the daily specials being so diverse but always eye catching. The Wine and beer selection may not be huge but they offer the very best. and the service is top notch. The waiters and waitresses are kind, and very good at taking care of there customers. The Flat Rock Grille is a place where you will truly have a one of a kind experience. TRUST ME!!!
5	pos	train	A friendly and peaceful atmosphere including lit candles and a beautiful mural of an authentic Italian landscape/scenery. The service was prompt and friendly, and the owner, Vito, even approached each table to make sure the guests were completely satisfied. The food was delicious-everything was cooked to perfection! I had fettucine alfredo, which was made with fresh cheeses and garlic, served with golden brown garlic knots. The portions were large and filling; our only regret was not saving our apetite to select from the dessert tray which was brought to our table! Truly a fantastic meal and a real taste of Italy!
5	pos	train	Best restaurant in Nothrern Colorado They just opened and are amazing!!!
5	pos	train	You'll find many Ambassadors and other Diplomats at this American/Italian restaurant, as it is only a few blocks from the UN. With seasonal menus that change, the food is always amazingly delicious, pairing unique flavors, and enticing one to eat something they may never have before (try the skate wing!) Everything is presented so beautifully, you don't want to touch it -- but do - you wont regret it! As a bonus, they give you goat cheese as a spread for your bread -- what a surprising treat!
5	pos	train	The absolutely Best meal and restaurant experience that anyone can have. From the moment you enter till the second you leave, every detail is taken care of. Truly a magnificent way to spend a few hours. The selection of steaks, fresh fish and seafood was perfect. Dinning in the wine cellar also only further adds to the experience.
5	pos	train	"We could not tell from the name what this restaurant is about but we went anyway. I thought I went to fishermen wharf because we end up having live shrimp, crab, oyster, lobster and rock cod all at once. I would like to go back and try that ""funny"" looking ""geo duck"" thing next time because the ladies kept going to visit the ever changing color fish tank for its look. It was a little pricy compare to other Chinese dinner we have had but a real great bargain compare to any seafood restaurant. Not to mention their sake, I lost count of them because they were soooooooo good!!!"
5	pos	train	We went with a group of friends and the Shields Manor Bistro closed the restaurant for our group. We had 2 menu selections - Prime Rib and Stuffed Chicken Breast. Our meal started with a delicious house salad with a balsamic vinagrette dressing - the salad was topped with pears that had been soaked in balsamic vinegar - delicious. The Prime Rib was excellent - It was served with a baked potato and delicious homestyle green beans. The chicken was stuffed with spinach and pine nuts - it was good, but a little dry. It was served with delicious mashed potatoes and the great green beans. For dessert, the Shields had lots to choose from. Chocolate Cake, Cheesecakes, Pies, and even some sugar free choices. I had the apple pie and it was out of this world - it was baked by owner Max Shields. The highlight of the meal was the fabulous service. After owner DeDe Shields prepared our food in the kitchen, she came out and went to each table to welcome everyone and see if everyone was enjoying their meal. All of the wait staff was courteous and friendly - service was excellent. This is a great place for a nice romantic meal. I will go back!
5	pos	train	I have to say the most pleasant dining experience I have had is at the Southside Bistro. The food is outstanding, even food items you don't normally like taste great. The portions are perfect as well as the timing of the courses. The service is the same if there is a crowd or not, simply outstanding. It's not inexpensive but it is worth every penny. Excellent establishment.
5	pos	train	This place is very inexpenisve and an awesome place to eat Chinese Food, hope you locals out in Irvine, CA check this place out !!!!!
5	pos	train	The owner was especially pleasant to talk with and was very dedicated to ensuring he was making authentic Louisiana food. The meal was OUTSTANDING! I had gumbo, my wife roast beef sandwich. We were both very pleased with the atmosphere and the food. Gumbo was just like home, except without the squirrel meat.
5	pos	train	Had some fantastic food at Gyro Kebab! Had chicken gyros, hummus (the best I've had) and alexander kebabs, which were so flavorful. The plates came with many sides dishes. The deserts are yummy too! Service was very friendly and fast. Lots of food for great prices. I'll go back soon!
5	pos	train	A fun place to go in Memphis, anytime. Menu is excellent and food is done in a very creative fashion. Certainly, a happenjing place in downtown and I always look forward to coming here. It's in an area of fine restaurants and things to do.
5	pos	train	We had an awesome night there! Our waitress was really nice and our Cookie Monster dessert was amazing and my chicken salad was delicious, too! And the prices were really reasonable! We are glad we went!
5	pos	train	We had a great time and the servers were very polite.
5	pos	train	Open since 1926. Premier roadfood experience in east Tennessee. Only open for lunch from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Daily lunch specials. great burgers, and americana food.. Save room for dessert. Many famous celebrities have eaten here!!
5	pos	train	The food was delicious and the staff was very attentive. Things were rather crowded when we arrived without reservations, and the hostess was very accommodating. The menu offers a terrific selection of Indian Cuisine and is moderately priced. Some of the best service by wait staff that I have had in any restaurant in San Francisco.
5	pos	train	Henry's Soul Cafe is fabulous!
5	pos	train	This Cuban bakery features such delights as guava pie, coconut strudel and strawberry/cream cheese croissants. Open only for breakfast & lunch, the wait can sometimes be long and if they call your number - be ready. They will pass right over it if you are daydreaming! For lunch, they have hot croissants, traditional cuban sandwiches and hot meat pies. Porto's also has amazing cakes, made to order. Try the tres leches cake, guava cake and flan.
5	pos	train	Four of us enjoy ourselves. our waiter was wonderful. he made us feel very welcome. The hamburger I ordered was heaven. Thanks
5	pos	train	The hardest thing to find in South Florida is good Mexican-American cooking at a reasonable price. There are many restaurants which serve Mexican food of the authentic variety from Mexico City or the Norteno food of Nuevo Leon, but few which serve Tex-Mex or Cal-Mex food to which many Americans are accustomed. I personally prefer the Tex-Mex variety, especially the beef enchiladas. I have eaten around, trying to find just that perfect balance of tastes which I prefer and finally discovered El Torito Grill. I hope these guys don't get sued by the real El Torito people, because their restaurant is just dandy. The food, service, and ambience of the place are all fabulous and the prices are downright cheap. I had the enchilada dinner, one beef and one cheese enchilada (my choice), with rice and beans. Along with this perfect combination plate I had a side order of Guacamole which arrived in a molecate. My wife had the grilled chicken breast which came with black beans and white rice along with some platanos maduros. Not Mexican, but if you want to survive successfully as a latin restaurant in South Florida, you need a combination like this. My wife's friend had the Chicken quesadilla which came with crema and guacamole toppings. We all agreed that the food was delicious and served piping hot. Although we did not order fajitas, a couple near us did and they arrived on a sizzling platter filling the air with their aroma. The restaurant is decorated in typical Mexican restaurant motif with serapes and sombreros on the walls. Latin music is played on the sound system however, many nights the is entertainment with dancing in the bar area. The restaurant has a 2 for one margarita special on some nights. I give it twenty five big happy faces.
5	pos	train	When we came through the front door, the atmosphere hit us. The Interior was so warm and friendly. The food was all homemade and delicious and hot. The service was first class and we will definately go back again.
5	pos	train	"I have been to the restaurant many times with various friends and family, and we all plan to go back again. The stuffed mushrooms are the best I've ever had, as was the lasagna. I've had their ""Sunday Ragu"" which is a pasta served with a combination of different meats -- suberb! It is really nice to hear the jazz combo on Fridays, Saturdays and Sunday brunch. The restaurant is definitely a must try. You won't be disappointed."
5	pos	train	I went to college at SUNY Binghamton years ago and if there was one place i could revisit, it would be The Spot! Miss the Boston Creme pie and the menu that seemed to go on forever....
5	pos	train	Review Deleted due to posting Policy violations.
5	pos	train	My new favorite restaurant, even with the hour wait. Have a drink at the bar, relax and enjoy the atmosphere while waiting. It's worth it.
5	pos	train	What a great place to find genuine Italian cooking. If you are used to crusty Italian bread, homemade sauces, and real Italian ingredients, this is the place. The people are friendly, nice atmosphere (nothing pretentious, just simple), the prices are as if they were not interested in a profit. I moved from Jersey to Roanoke, Virginia and thought I would never find such a place this far south. If you are in the Roanoke area, don't miss it.
5	pos	train	There's not a lot of deli's in Atlanta that bake their own breads, let alone make their own soups & cream pies. The interior is not a typical New York deli, but more modern, like the city of Atlanta. Decorated with sleek black chairs, set off by marble-style tabletops, cobalt halogen lighting and suede textural wall covering. Very nice alternative to the pre-weight, pre-baked, pre-packaged deli chain.
5	pos	train	A superbly prepared 24 ounce veal chop at less than $20. Service when you wanted it and not overbearing. Fabulous deserts that would feed an army. Do not miss this restaurant if you are in Orlando. It will be the hit of your dining experiences.
5	pos	train	This is a quaint little sandwich shop we discovered just off Highway 1 when we were on holiday. It has the best juice drinks, sandwiches and soups I have ever eaten. It is only open from 10-4PM and the local clientale rushes in as the soups often sell out early. They have a darling little courtyard and play jazz standards. If you're traveling through California to the Hearst Castle then this is a must-visit. 5 stars
5	pos	train	This is a small wine and food bistro in old town Katy (just west of Houston). They have over 350 wines and one of the most knowledgable sommeliers` I have encountered in the Houston area. The atmosphere is European-West Coast and the food fresh and inventive at a pretty good price. The daily special was excellent. It is so great to see a place like this in the Burbs!!
5	pos	train	Tanaka is a sushi master like none other. The sushi at Tanaka's is by far, the best I have ever had. Tanaka offers personal service, and let us try, for free, types of fish we'd never even heard of! The rolls are all delicious, with homemade sauces. And at the end of the meal, he gave us complementary carved-fruit desserts! A great find in a town with more restaurants-even sushi restaurants- than I've been able to sample, even after living here for 6 years. The price is right and the fish is even better. Love it Love it Love it.
5	pos	train	"This is a GREAT place!!! it doesnt matter if you are dinning or just hanging out at the bar the atmosphere there is unbeleivable, the staff always seemed happy, the bartenders are a riot and the menu has a large veriety of foods(some with a tropical twist) and some of the best wings ive ever had. i highly recommend stopping in if you are ever visiting ocean isle beach, and when you do ask for the owner by his nickname ""poolside"" and get him to tell you a joke."
5	pos	train	nice quiet restaurant with candlelit tables, great food
5	pos	train	"This restaurant is CLASSIC Cincinnati. The service was exceptional - quick, fun atmosphere. Almost a New-York-Deli-style atmosphere without the rudeness. The food is Greek style chili. It's Cincinnati's trademark, and a tradition fairly unique to Cincinnati. The taste is NOT red-hot Texas chili - it's a sweet+cinnamon taste that just leaves you wanting more. The spacious seating at lunch time allows you to be comfortable at a ""deuce"" (table for 2), while sharing your intimate conversation with your closest new friends - strangers before you entered the restaurant! Free Ice-Tea refills and a secure u-park-it style parking lot are some other ammenities. We left the restaurant smiling and satisfied from a delicious lunch. We will be back there!"
5	pos	train	Absolutely the best Italian food in Denver. I can't believe more people don't talk about this place. It was authentic and not like the chains that keep coming out high on ratings. The food was awesome!!
5	pos	train	I have been there on serveral occasion. The food and service is great. This is one of my two most favorite restaurants. Please try it, you'll love it.
5	pos	train	The service was gracious and attentive without being intrusive. The food was simply inspired. This is indeed a very expensive restaurant, but I certainly didn't leave feeling I'd been overcharged; rather, I spent a lot of money for a superb dinner that was worth it. One of the best restaurants in Washington.
5	pos	train	Best barbecue around. The barbecue sauce (medium) is the best I've had in my life. Wish I knew how to make it.
5	pos	train	The Bar-J makes the best Texas-style chili east of the Mississippi. They have a friendly staff and ice-cold beer on tap. I highly recommend the Burritos too.
5	pos	train	Cozy, great food, nice folks!
5	pos	train	It was a fine experience
5	pos	train	The food and service was excellente! (just like New York)
5	pos	train	You absolutly cannot judge this place by it's appearance. The price was a little higher than expected but ok for Nigara Falls. The food was outstanding and the portions were large. The service was good. I felt welcome from the time I entered. I highly reccomend this place and will return myself.
5	pos	train	This was my first time visiting Rhode Island I was so impressed with 22 Bowens !!! The atmosphere was very calm, friendly and relaxing. The service was awesome!!!!! The server paid very close attention to what your needs were and fullfilled them. He answered every question that we had. I have never tasted a better sirloin in my live!!! The food was worth every $$$. I will refer anyone and everyone to 22 Bowens . It's a must have experience!!!!!!!!
5	pos	train	Menu was not overwhelming and more than adequate to suit any taste-including children. Good wine and beer selection. Very creative and great tasting dishes. Seafood was very fresh done to perfection. Atmosphere was very comfortable. A great place to have a relaxing dinner. Tables weren't too close and truely smoke-free dining. Smoking and bar area also available.
5	pos	train	This cozy Mexican restaurant has a live singer, glowing florescent sombreros on the ceiling in the bar, and killer margaritas. Try the green corn tamales (often on special) - out of this world. Then after, try the Tiki Ti or Good Luck Bar for dangerous tropical drinks.
5	pos	train	One of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in Saint Louis. My wife is Chinese and loves their Sichuan Duck. The tables are decorative Qing-style chinese, and though sometimes crowd, the crowds are due to the popularity.
5	pos	train	Uniqueness is what makes Bern's so great. The quality and service is superb. You select a steak from the menu which they then hand trim, removing all the fat. You then get soup and salad, which you do not pay extra for like other fancy restaurants. Your server will ask if you want reservation for a dessert room upstairs after dinner. If you don't do this your crazy! Also, ask for a tour of the kitchen and wine cellar, you'll be amazed!
5	pos	train	Well I have heard about this restaurant from alot of people so I decided to go with some friends-I am so glad I did. The baby back ribs came right off the smoker and fell right off the bone. My friends had a pulled pork sandwich, which they loved. We topped off our meal with homemade pie, fantastic! They told us that everything on their menu was made by the husband and wife who owned it. Needs some color inside though, but very clean. We will return again! Great job! Keep up the great food! Your kids are great too. J. Bell
5	pos	train	If there ever was a burger that would make you slap your Momma, Taylors Refreshers Blue Cheese burger is the one! Not that I am advocating slapping your mamma but this burger is just that good! Fresh juicy and very, very flavorful. They make several different equally as good burgers including the Wisconsin Sourdough burger and one named the Western Bacon Blue Ring which consist of a blue cheese filled onion ring, bacon and BBQ sauce. Located on Highway 29 in the heart of wine country, Taylors is a welcome break from the ordinary burger. You can order everything from Grilled cheese to Fish Tacos to Chinese chicken Salad, whenever I am in the Napa California region, I try to make a point to visit Taylors Automatic Refreshers.
5	pos	train	"One of San Francisco's best kept secrets. Its cozy old America style was a breathe of fresh air in this world of over modernistic downtown eaterys. Also located in what seems a world away in the loveley West portal district. This romantic dinner house with their knowledgable servers carries such platters as the ""red wine braised short ribs with garlic mashed potatoes, natural gravy and juliened vegetables or the equally delicious ""Duck To Ways"". Meaning yes it is prepared two ways. The breast is sauteed and the leg confit,both in a savory cherry port sauce on a bed of soft polenta and corn salad. Not to mention their creative salads and appetizers,one being the pear salad with baby mix greens,candied walnuts and crumbled blue cheese and the rock shrimp cakes a flavorfull change from the typical crab cakes. Reservations reccomended yet if you'r asked to wait in their great bar it's not exactly a punishment. Serving up great martinis,cosmos and lemon drops in Grande martini glasses not to mention great tunes.This eatery is a must if you live in the bay area."
5	pos	train	Casual and friendly, well priced and a full menu. Great for family seating or small parties. Yes on the food -- all good that I've had. And the dessert menu is pretty scrumptious -- ya gotta try the Chocolate Mess!!!
5	pos	train	all 4 of us,long time crabcake lovers, agreed that these crabcakes were the most delicious we had ever tasted anywhere.
5	pos	train	Great family style breakfast. Egg, Bacon, fried potatos, toast, Amana sausages, and it was all you can eat. All you got to do is ask them to bring more and they do. Also need to mention they worked with our milk and nuts alergy son. Thanks!
5	pos	train	This place is the whole in the wall everyone looks for when they come to Denver. Multiple locations, but only 5 Original's and plenty of imitators. When you go there, you can't go wrong with Smothered Burritos, Smothered Steak Burritos, Smothered Mexican Hamburgers, Smothered Chili Fries and their Tostadas are the best. Check it out!
5	pos	train	Have been there a couple of times with a large group. Love the individual room and ambiance. Food was excellent and service timely and polite. The owners were very friendly. We felt welcome and as if we had known them for a long time. I highly recommend it for groups and special occasions.
5	pos	train	A cozy little place - not fancy, very comfortable in either casual or somewhat dressy wear. Served promptly and with a friendly greeting. Order taken quickly, and food arrived hot. It was delicious! Huge portions of lasagna, and warm bread. Very good value for the price. Would visit again. Thank you!
5	pos	train	The Pilot House offers a spectacular view of the water and yachts docked at the Forge Landing Marina. The restaurant is a lighthouse-style building with 240 exposed beams, a 20-foot sail fan, and windows that encircle the entire dining area. The enclosed deck allows you to dine year-round while enjoying fine view of the Marina.
5	pos	train	We had a table for five inside (as opposed to on the top deck). The service was prompt and courteous. The food was great and prices were very reasonable. Most of the lunch offerings were under $10, and the menu features a lot of options--from chicken to pasta to seafood. The place doesn't have the cleaniless feel of a five-star joint, but we didn't find any hair in our food like another reviewer either, so all walked away happy. The view from inside is so-so. The idea that you're eating on the water is neat...but the view is of the other boats docked in that area...not a view of Lake Erie like you might think. The top deck might serve better views of the area and tha planes taking off from the airport nearby.
5	pos	train	This restaurant really is a pleasant surprise in Tallahassee. The cuisine really has a unique Modern American flair. You really can't find this kind of food anywhere else in Tallahassee. Dishes like Tapenade Grouper with Cherry Tomatoes, Artichokes, Roasted Pepper Pesto and Lemon Risotto are simply delicious. I would definitely look this place up whenever you visit this city. Excellent!
5	pos	train	I just want to thank Cafe Laurent for its wonderful and fantastic food...I'm now a regular customer and I want everyone around the area to try it. For years, my friends and I are being trying to find a nice quality place to go and eat... and really we got so lucky to have such a wonderful place to enjoy now...not only the food but also the beautiful patio where you just feel out of the city.
5	pos	train	I agree with the first post regarding service at this restaurant. It is very hard to get and if they forget something - they are rude, it's like you did something to upset their routine.
5	pos	train	"I've lived in Knoxville since 1981 and dined at Litton's probably 35-40 times over that span of time. We routinely take relatives and friends from other cities and states to Litton's; they are never disappointed. They repeatedly ask to go back. I agree Litton's is five stars across the board. The desserts and burgers are ten stars. So is the service. Somehow the waiters and waitresses there seem more ""seasoned"" to their task, even though they're for the most part only slightly older than most waitresses. There is a decidedly ""Litton's attitude"" about even the youngest of them. I have never encountered a Litton's employee who acted as if he or she wanted to be somewhere else, right then as they're serving you, as is so often the case in many restaurants. I don't know how Barry Litton and his managers do this, but it shows. Tucked away in the Fountain City area of Knoxville, Litton's is tough to find for outsiders but well worth the effort. The Merchant's road exit (108) off I-75 -- turning left on Merchant's if you're going south on the freeway, right if you're going north -- will put you on the right path. Merchant's becomes Cedar Lane and will lead you 2.7 miles from the freeway exit through a residential area to the Fountain City Duck Pond (yeah) and North Broadway. Litton's is across Broadway from the Pond, to the right (behind) the Exxon Station. Look for the green sign. Remember: the ducks can see Litton's.. Keep in mind that Litton's is closed on Sundays, most major holidays and the entire week of July 4. The same Litton family has operated the place since it's inception. The floors are real wood, darkened by the shoes of thousands of patrons -- that same kind of blackened floor you see in very old, out of the way general stores..Framed photos of local patrons and friends adorn the walls, as well as letters of praise from schoolchildren done in crayon or pencil on lined paper, Mom & Dad's stationery, napkins -- often with drawings. ""Litton's Is Like Paradise"" said one little girl. Litton's passes my most crucial test for independent restaurants, diners and cafes: it projects a personality. The vast majority of eateries that have personalities have great food. The mood here is community and family, and quality. There is an atmosphere more like some places you'd find along a seashore than you'd expect in landlocked Tennessee. I can't quite frame it: it's like you're on vacation there even when you have to work the next day. When you walk into Litton's I guarantee you everyone at every table is talking. All at the same time.. It's a happy energetic buzz. I don't just go to Litton's to eat, I go to defuse and let it all go. Prices are average, servings are definitely above average in size here. All the food is terrific. My only complaint is that they dropped several items from their menu some years ago, including a grouper (or was it halibut?) fish dinner that I loved. (It was REALLY good.) The rib eye steaks, Fountain City Club sandwiches, Thunder Road Cheeseburger, everything is good at Litton's. The desserts, displayed right up front in the waiting area, are to die for. Cheesecakes are some of the best I've ever had, including a fudge swirl looking concoction of dark and light chocolate (""Day and Night"") I've only dared to have three times. Cake servings (Red Velvet, Italian Cream, others ) are twice the size you'll get in most restaurants, so you might want to go one for two. When my wife is with me I'm not even allowed to look at the dessert counter..You can buy an entire pie, cheesecake or cake to take with you. And there are signature chocolate chip cookies the size of saucers, with ""chips"" that are more like chunks of chocolate. Those oversized cookies are never as good, right? Litton's knew you'd think that way.. Although my wife went to high school with the owner, I don't know the family and have never spoken with them. But I do know their restaurant like an old friend.There are great places to eat in Tennessee. I've been to many of them. Litton's has to be among the top ten we have. Dan MacDonald Knoxville, TN"
5	pos	train	We had a bachelorette party with 15 of us. everything was great, except 2 things it was very, hot in the club area, to where we were sweating all night and the music was too 80's , need to upgrade the music defenitely
5	pos	train	There are so many good entrees especially the seafood! Delicious seasoning and sauces. Entertainment on the weekends. Great Portuguese food.
5	pos	train	This neat little restaurant had a limited selection of excellent food. It is a little tough to pick out of the shops on the side of the road, but the open windows and relaxed atmosphere made the experience quite enjoyable. The only problem was that the hot chocolate that my friend ordered was luke warm. Other than that a great experience.
5	pos	train	We visit new restaurants on a regular basis. We heard about this one on a local radio station and had passed it many times. The food was very good. The server we had was very curteous and took very good care of us. We noticed that all of the servers were the same, making the atmosphere very pleasant to be in. There was no delays in seating or getting our food. I would recommend it to anyone in the Stafford/Fredricksburg area!
5	pos	train	Great place to eat as a couple or with a family. Once you've ordered your meal, you are directed to a homemade bread and homemade soup table where you can help yourself to these delicious food items. Meals have hearty portions. If you leave hungry, it's your own fault! Food is great, service friendly, atmosphere is sporty and restaurant is clean. Plenty of parking.
5	pos	train	We had an excellent time here. The atmosphere is really fun, the service is friendly and the food is excellent. Great place in a great location.
5	pos	train	This is a small, Japanese cuisine/sushi bar restaurant. It's dining area could hold no more than 75 people. It's a quiet, pleasant setting with authentic background music and oriental decor. The food is excellent, and the sushi is the freshest I've ever had. I try to go there every week, as it's my favorite place to go to enjoy myself.
5	pos	train	Hands down the best mexican restaurant I've ever experienced (yes, including chelino's). My local Monterey Jack's is around 60th and May, acrossed the street from Best Buy.
5	pos	train	This is a lovely restaurant at the fork of the Batsto and Mullica Rivers in the heart of the Pine Barrens (Sweetwater, NJ) The hostess (Emmy) is a treasure and never fails to make us feel welcome. She always goes out of her way to make our dining experience a special one. The food is well above par and the wait-service is excellent. My husband and I travel about 20 miles almost every weekend to dine there, passing lots of very good establishments on the way.
5	pos	train	Absolutely a great dining experience. This place is part of St Joseph's history. The western atmosphere is wonderful. Definately not plain, there are many interesting pieces of history all over inside and the staff seemed to be very educated about their restaurant. Most of them have been there atleast 15 years! We have eaten here several times... no matter if its been just my husband and I, a party of 10, or a carryout order...HANDS DOWN its always a pleasent experience.
5	pos	train	The food was excellent. We enjoyed the finest dining experience that Huntsville has to offer. The steak was tender and its taste was fabulous. The sauteed mushrooms are best I have ever had. This is an upscale restaurant in a town known for its fast food eateries. Best time to dine is Friday and Saturday as usually there is musical entertainment. Highly recommended!!!!
5	pos	train	We were in Vancouver for a Cisco convention in 1999 (I'm writing this in 2002, that's how good this place is) and the concierge at the Sheraton Wall Centre steered us to Bin 941. During our short stay, we ate there twice. We sampled delicious local beer and watched the chef prepare our dinner. The Navajo bread with foccacia and salsa was out of this world (my husband said that the salsa convinced him that tomatos were, indeed, a fruit). Beef wellington wrapped in philo dough. I loved Vancouver, but would return solely to eat at Bin 941 again.
5	pos	train	"This is a great place to get a real homemade breakfast at any time of the day. The service is hometown friendly, the chef even serves you coffee (excellent blend). You will not go away hungry if you order the ""Plowman's Special"". The pancakes are not those ""see through"" type they are hearty topped with grains, nuts and seeds. The bacon and fruits are made to order. On weekends, it's busy but worth the wait! Especially during the ski season at Hunter. And don't mind that the floor is not level."
5	pos	train	Very warm and cozy feeling. friendly staff and owner is always there(she does all the cooking) We will definitely make Tavolini our regular dining spot!
5	pos	train	"Since hearing about Cafe Laurent from a friend, my wife and I have now been there two weekends in a row. The first weekend, we knew we had to return to sample other items on the menu and the cheesecake was to die for. On our second visit my wife had French Toast and loved it. I had a special fritatta in a croissant that was so good that it must have been illegal! All that and ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" in one day; I think I have died and gone to heaven!"
5	pos	train	I have 5 children who all have differing tastes. This restaurant had something for everyone. The steaks are thick and juicy and my wife's broiled cod was the best she ever had. The meal comes with the salad bar and a huge dessert bar. Very good and not too expensive.
5	pos	train	This is a chain restaurant, and is the BEST! It is a Tex-Mex joint and has the best food, and drinks! I would STRONGLY suggest the Chicken Taquitos for an appetizer! I have been to 2 different ones in the DC area, and also 1 in NYC, and 1 in SFO - and I have nothing but rave reviews for each of them! Service is always friendly and the atmosphere is excellent - salsa music playing and people having a great time! reservations are not required, but on weekends I would suggest calling ahead and getting your name on the list, unless that is you like to be standing in a line out the door (usually only on Fri. & Sat. though)!
5	pos	train	Consistantly the best Chinese food I have ever had. Host and staff very friendly. It is noisy because it full of people enjoying themselves. Try the Honey Walnut Shrimp, it is to die for.
5	pos	train	If you want quality -- and I mean quality -- food, a variety of specials and a great atmosphere, this is the place. We had a meal that cost us an average of $12 (with wine) that would normally have cost double at another restaurant and with not as good food. Be prepared to wait in line during the week-ends, but it's worth it!
5	pos	train	Took myself and children and had fabulous food, service and entertainment. Enjoyed very much.
5	pos	train	"It was a wonderful dining experience. The atmosphere was warm and inviting and romantic for those there for romance. Service was excellent and food fantastic. Who says you have to go to a ""big"" city to get wonderful food! It's a great little secret in Platte county. Find out for yourself. Enjoy! Suzanne"
5	pos	train	We had a great time at Venue. The staff at the restaurant were extremely attentive. The atmosphere was warm and very comfortable. Every little detail was taken care of. The food was excellent and the bar churned out some extremely wonderful cocktails.
5	pos	train	The food and ambiance were excellent. It is the best meal for the price in a very upscale market... Bucks County, PA
5	pos	train	Friendly Hometown atmosphere. Excellent variety of food. What a pleasent surprise. Great mix of American , Italian foods. The Ribs were to die for. Also a great Bar to meet with friends. I can't wait to return.
5	pos	train	Slogar's is a family-style fried chicken restaurant in the ski resort community of Crested Butte. They serve only fried chicken and one kind of steak (get the chicken), which comes with a starter of coleslaw, cottage cheese and cruidites served with tomato chutney - everything is homemade and very fresh. Then comes the main course - fried chicken seasoned and cooked to perfection, with mashed potatoes, creamed corn, gravy, biscuits and jam.Perfect after a full day of skiing. Not for dieters! Since everything is served in large family style bowls, there is more than enough to go around. If you want stick-to-your-ribs food - Slogar's is the place.
5	pos	train	Today was my 7th visit to the resaurant. Finkerman's BBQ is not only excellent, it is consistant. I have been for several years a big fan of its sister restaurant, Ariel's in Brookfield Vermont. A very different restaurant of similar high quality. This one is operated by Lee's sister, an experienced graduate of NECI. Sorry I am forgetting her name, but it is clear that she has Lee and Richard's instincts about how to take care of people who like good food. Reservations are suggested at Vermont mealtimes as the restaurant is frequently very busy, the parking lot pretty full. The owners chose to open with little sound absorbing material in the dining rooms. I believe that they will be adding materials that will reduce the amount of sound in both rooms in the near future. But that should not keep anyone away. Although it may not be the place for a romantic meal during dinnertimes, it can be at other times. And, I suspect it may get to be romantic even during dinnertime and lunchtime in the future. Not mentioned in other reviews is the family orientation of this restaurant. There is a playroom with local artist mural on the wall. It is a great place for kids who don't want to stay at the table as long as adults. This importance of this parent-friendly touch is not to be underestimated.
5	pos	train	An elegant but friendly Northern Italian ambiance. Charming waitstaff -- very helpful and fun. Very Italian -- very continental. Great Italian food (not the red sauce kind)-- wonderful chef-owned restaurant. In summer, a lovely outdoor eating area -- I return to this restaurant regularly. Have never had a bad experience.
5	pos	train	I just moved to Mariposa, and the night I unloaded the truck, I came to town to eat. For some reason, I chose The Gold Rush. I was surprised how late they were open, and even more surprised at the fair prices. But I was pleasantly surprised at the meal that arrived. Huge helpings and good tasting. I now eat there two or three times a week. Supper is fabolous there, but I highly recomend breakfast! There's an unbelievably good breakfast of: 3-eggs, & ham-or-bacon-or sausage & hash browns-or-biscuts-and-gravy & buttermilk pan-cakey's ......... all served at once for a bargain price. The employees are all so kind and friendly; especially to me, the new stranger in town. My drink is always full and my food comes hot.
5	pos	train	Cafe Brasil is an incredible culinary experience if you are in search of good authentic Brazilian cuisine. The restaurant was destroyed by a fire on January 2004 and 10 months later like the mythical Phoenix, Cafe Brasil rose from the ashes, continuing its tradition of tantalizing taste bud experience and four star service. When we arrived we knew we in for something special when we observed the masses patiently waiting for their turn to be seated, our wait of 1 hour was more than worth it, when we finally sampled the breakfast menu and the fresh squeezed orange juice. Most of the diners I chatted with had nothing but praise for the service and the food, one young man claims he eats at Cafe Brasil four times a week. Cafe Brasil seems to be a popular UC Santa Cruz dining spot and is located minutes from the popular Santa Cruz beach and boardwalk (driving time).I plan on returning to Cafe Brasil as soon as humanly possible.
5	pos	train	Wonderful. Great place to go on a date with your husband, or your could even take the whole family. There is something for everyone.My husband and I recently went to dinner at Jameson Char House,in Mount Prospect, IL. It was really nice. You get alot of food for your money. We enjoyed a reasonably priced cocktail and then split an appetizer of Stuffed mushrooms with spinach and hollandaise sauce. With your entree you get soup, salad, bake potato or rice and a big bunch of fresh broccoli. We both got filet mignon. The portions could have been alittle bigger, but they tasted really great. Good quality of food. Very nice atmosphere. You need to make sure you make reservations, it gets really crowded. They have complimentary valet parking too!
5	pos	train	I have been to many Japanese Buffet style restaurants. There is definitely a difference in the quality of food, precision of display, and service/stewardship at Todai San Diego. I've even been to other Todai restaurants and this one is not only the largest, but has the best variety in food choices. My family and I always have a great dining experience at Todai and I would highly recommend you try it for yourself!
5	pos	train	It was a very pleasantful experience. I enjoyed the setting, which felt nice and cozy. I felt almost like I was sitting at home. The service was great. They explained how it might take a little longer than most places to get my food, because everything was made fresh to order, which I didn't mind waiting for if it was being made fresh. I don't think anyone would mind waiting a little longer for food if it's fresh. Their mocha's, I think, are better than any place that I've been before. Better than Starbucks. I really enjoyed myself while I was there, and I'm definately going to return next week.
5	pos	train	Excellent experience! My girlfriends and I were starving last Wednesday and decided to try Senix Creek Inn. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they had an all you can eat shrimp special where you could have your shrimp scampi style, stuffed, fried or buffalo style. PLUS you got a side of pasta with alfredo sauce, marinara sauce or scampi sauce, whichever you prefer. Our salads were amazingly fresh and we got cole slaw with dinner, too. We went to being famished to being totally satisfied. And the shrimp dinner is only $16.95! Sarah, Michaela and I plan on going back every Wednesday we can.
5	pos	train	AMAZING! Love, love, LOVE this place - it has a beautiful atmosphere. Pleasant, quiet, and yummy. Everyone who works there has a friendly, courteous attitude. The price is a little up there, but WELL WORTH IT. Cameron Mitchell owns a great group of restaurants (another one of my favs being Martini!!!) I highly suggest you get to Mitchells if you live ANYWHERE near Columbus, Ohio...! :) :)
5	pos	train	FOOD IS DA BOMB, INEXPENSIVE, GREAT SERVICE, AND OF COURSE, IT'S IN DALY CITY
5	pos	train	Mario's is a family run restaurant. The food is cooked to order and I think it's the best Italian food I have had, outside of my Mama's and Mother-in-laws home.
5	pos	train	The experience was great, starting from the reservation. We let them know we had two vegatarian friends and they explained they would create special dishes for them when they arrived. They sat us in a wonderful table. The sevice was excellent and they started us with bread and three types of butter (salmon, guava and garlic). We started with a seafood appetizor and Inspired Nachos that were awesome. Our vegetarian friends were asked what they were interested in eating and the chef created two special meals that were fantastic. The rest of us had fish, steak and pastas that were all excellent. We ended with deserts chocolata pate and apple/cranberry crunble with the best ice cream we've ever had. Where does she get all this great food?
5	pos	train	Great food, small cozy atmosphere. Wonderful food selection and nice staff. Great value!!!!
5	pos	train	It was very good and I have gone back numerous times. I would recommend it to anyone who is in the area. You'll have a very pleasant experience! (and as a little treat, on your birthday you get a free dessert!)
5	pos	train	I am originally from N.Y. I happen to be the biggest veal critic. This by far is the best I have ever eaten. The Picata is outstanding, the appetizers are outrageous the spaghetti & garlic is to die for. Not to mention all the other delicious items on the menu. The deserts are incredible too!...Ohh let me stop!! my stomach is starting to growl just thinking about there food. Great atmosphere too!! Definitely two thumbs up. It's the best dining I have ever experienced.
5	pos	train	Exquisite dining experience. Entertaining guests from out-of-town, a definite must try!! Chef/Owner Jimmy Schmidt and Executive Chef Chris Franz present some amazing food -- best steaks in the city! Desserts rock, service is exceptional! Don't miss the view!
5	pos	train	I love this place so much that I try to go there once a week for lunch. It is a respite for a bad day at work.
5	pos	train	I reguarly eat at the Mayflower. It is a beautiful restaurant and the view from the window is pretty Plymouth Harbour and the Mayflower. In summer the deck is open and you can eat and drink under the stars watching the boats in the Marina and Harbour float on the water. The view is fantstic. The food is superb and reliably good. Their bruschetta appetiser is garlicky and served with shrimp and scallops - plenty for two. All their seafood dishes are exquisitely seasoned and the steaks are cooked to your specification. They serve lamb chops and plenty of chicken dishes, plus they cater to vegetarians. You may ask for something special as often they are only too willing to accomodate. If you are visiting Plymouth this is a worthwhile restaurant in which to eat. By the way, there is no need to book a table on the open air deck during the summer, plenty of room for all!
5	pos	train	This place is amazingly breathtaking once you step inside. Not any other Indian Cuisine. It stands out from the atmosphere to the music and food presentation. The price is fair, food is great and service is friendly.
5	pos	train	Cool Spot! Beautiful people, great food. We sat outside and had a great meal. We will do it again soon!
5	pos	train	Muy buena comida y exelente vino y exelente merera se llama Marisol...............two . Very good food and excellent-wine the waitress named Marisol was excellent too.
5	pos	train	I agree! What a great place for some warm comforting wonton soup. Excellent side dishes too- perfect place on a cold rainy day in San Francisco. can't wait for the next cold and rainy afternoon, we are so there!
5	pos	train	Pasha has a very chic, hip atmosphere with attentive, knowledgeable servers, and delicious cuisine. They also are open very late (at least 4 am) and you can order off the dinner menu at that hour and receive full service. Later, when the crowd picks up even more, there is dancing and a real party atmosphere. A wonderful place, we have been there several times when passing through Chicago. Located on Clark near Ontario downtown.
5	pos	train	My boyfriend of five and a half years, Jai, and I go to Bugaboo all of the time!!! It is our favorite restaurant. Even if you don't like steak, they have great chicken, and fix too!!! Not to mention the entire building is filled with wild animals, and a singing bison. What a great experience. Try it, you will love it.
5	pos	train	great
5	pos	train	Very Appriciated Warming Under Construction, but the food made up for it.
5	pos	train	Loved it will be going back a lot
5	pos	train	We were immediately greeted at the door and seated. Our whole party of eight was not there yet, but the waitress stopped by multiple times to see if there was anything she could do for us. Their Clam Clam Clam Chowder is thicker and creamier than most and way more flavorful and has more clam pieces. My entree, garlic parmesan chicken pasta, was excellent. The sauce was light and not overpowering. The pasta was cooked correctly. The host stopped by twice while we were there to see if everything was up to our expectations. The waitress asked if we needed refills before they were gone. The menu is versatile and they offer a large selection of beer on tap, most notably the best microbrews from the area. Overall, the experience was way beyond compare.
5	pos	train	Forget that place Becco ,this place Sevilla blows it away. The food ,service and the feel is the way it should be who gives a crap about some old lady who cooks on T.V. do you think she is in the kitchen cooking for you No. I only say this because the food at Becco was disgusting and the next day we discover Meson Sevilla and it was another world This is the real deal the best on 46th street.
5	pos	train	"My son and I were in the Pomona area (4/6/04) and stopped here for lunch because of a recommendation. We ordered their Thai Fried Rice with chicken ($5.95 each) and an order of Fried Wontons ($4.25). Both were delicious, as were the sauces served with them. Lots of food. Service was very friendly. Restaurant has an ""A"" rating for cleanliness. We will return."
5	pos	train	"WOW!!! this place LOOKS like an ""ordinary"" pizza place from the outside --- from the 2 reviews I read here my hubby & I decided to give the place a try. We had a WONDERFUL meal!!! The food was EXCELLENT, she service was as well! there was a singer who was really good! I just can't say enough nice thing about this place. We will go back there for sure!!!"
5	pos	train	The best spicy food restaurant with great server and fast service. Just one bite and you will be right for the night, and plan for the next return.
5	pos	train	Great, can't wait to go on March 13th for the Beach Bash with the sand and mechanical bull!!!
5	pos	train	I remember meeting someone on the beach and Waikiki, and they asked me where I was from. When I told them I was from South Florida, they asked me why someone would fly 6000 miles just to go to another beach. I explained that Waikiki isn't just another beach because in the hotel courtyard ladies were dancing the hula. I bring this up as way of explaining how the Mai Kai in Ft. Lauderdale has survived so long and has prospered so well. Step into this slice of Polynesia and be transported thousands of miles away from South Florida. The Mai Kai was created in 1956 to resemble a polynesian village. From the outside, the restaurant looks like nothing else in the neighborhood. Tall green foliage surrounds it, tiki torches mark the boundries, a wooden bridge links the parking lot with the passing street and the thatched roof gives it the final touch. Inside, the bar has a nautical motif, but the restaurant itself continues the polynesian theme begun on the outside. Each Room reflects a different region of Polynesia and overlooks a waterfall or lagoon. Giant tiki scuptures guard the entrance to the gardens. Dinner at the Mai Kai is a mix of oriental and polynesian dishes. Hawaiian Chicken and and Chicken with a Ginger Peanut Sauce are among the best of the chicken entrees of which there are 11 on the menu. The beef dishes, all made with filet mignon, include the Mai Kai's very tasty orange beef, and a very delicious Bangkok Beef with Fresh Basil which is chunks of beef tenderloin, sauteed with straw mushrooms, bamboo shoots and fresh basil with Thai seasonings. There are 8 beef dishes on the menu. There are four pork dishes on the menu, the best being the Lemongrass Pork Tenderloin. Macadamia nut encrusted grouper tops the seafood menu which is full of all sorts of tasty treats from the seas. No dinner at the Mai Kai is complete without the pu pu platter. This combination plate for two features Shanghai Chicken, Egg Roll, Crab Rangoon and Tahitian Cheese Tangs. Appetizer people can order from a menu of nearly two dozen hot and cold dishes to whet your appetite before the big show. The show at the Mai Kai is something else again. If you have even been to the Polynesian Culture Center on Oahu, you know how beautiful and exciting a polynesian show can be. Which this one is neither as large or elaborate as the one in Hawaii, it is still the best one stateside. Featuring dances from all the polynesian islands, your guide, Sonny, makes it all fun and educational. The show ends with fire dancers and always gets big applause. And don't leave without trying one of the Mai Kai's desserts. If you have a party of four or more, try the Polynesian Surprise. A volcano of ice comes to your table covered with fruits and blazing with sparklers. The service is great, the food is very tasty, the show is second to none, and even if you aren't a tourist it is still worth a visit every now and then. If you are visiting Miami/Ft. Lauderdale the Mai Kai is a must.
5	pos	train	Fantastic combinations in flavor & textures. A wonderful new place, if a little noisy. Try the Peekytoe Crab, and is it's available, the Four Flavors Chocolate for dessert. The little amusee cups are a treat, as are the homeade lollipops you enjoy long after leaving.
5	pos	train	1. My experience at Sydnee DeMar was a pleasure! The food was delicious! It was served with style, flair and efficiency! The pasta and shrimp were my favorites along with the YaYa a.k.a seafood gumbo ! Watch out for the jerk wings ! Did I mention the leftovers? The entrees are well proportioned.... and are tasty treat when hunger strikes...again! This is a new restaurant we found near the Inner Harbor in Baltimore and it has been described as 'intimate, upscale and delicious!' Indeed so! The service was good ~ and the Manager greeted us at our table to ensure everything was prompt and in order. When you visit Sydnee DeMar you won't leave hungry and you'll have change too! Review submitted by: Angela Singletary 2. Sydnee Demar is one of the best places I have been to in a while. The food was excellent & affordable. The interior design is what impress me the most along with the service that was provided, it was fast & courteous. I strongly recommend this restaurant to many people. If you're looking for good food, a pleasant atmosphere, along with a professional and courteous staff then you need to come to Sydnee Demar ASAP. Much Success & Prayers for this beautiful establishment...
5	pos	train	Always very consistent and great value. This Brinker chain has found a winning formula!
5	pos	train	The best Hamburgers in East Texas. Bar None!!!! They also have Chicken Fried Steak Burgers that melt in your mouth. They also have a pot of beans on a simmer free of charge with your meal. Drive in avilable if you are in a hurry. At meal times you better be early or you will be standing.
5	pos	train	Our party of 4 had a great time at Robin's. Even though it was very busy, we didn't feel rushed. The ribs were fabulous. The meat fell right off the bone. Probably the best baby backs I've ever had. Other in our party split the huge Garbage Can Combo. It had samples of everything they smoke & it also was great. This is a really neat place. They seem to really care about your experience. We'll add Robin's to our growing list of discoveries thanks to we8there.com. Thanks. MT
5	pos	train	My husband visited Tia Rosa last May '04 and play to revisit in June '05! We loved the restaurant! The chips and salsa are nothing that we've ever had. We're from the Mid-West and after eating at this restaurant, we can hardly stand the taste of other Mexican restaurants. The seasonings and spices in the food was excellent. We loved it so much that on our way to the airport, we took an order to go on the plane! :-)
5	pos	train	This is probably one of the best places to dine before the symphony or the opera. But make your reservation early! If you let them know that you've got theater tickets, they'll make sure that your food is ready in a timely fashion and that you're out the door in time to make the show - all without rushing you! And try the fries!
5	pos	train	"This is a great burger bar. You can select a type of meat and the size of the burger (1/3 lb, 1/2 lb, 2/3 lb, 1 lb) and get it cooked the way you want (I like medium rare and they do a great medium rare). They cook it after you order it (how unusual these days). They make their own buns. They have many varieties of special burgers. They have a toppings/condiments area where you can put your burger together. It is great. Never ending supplies of lettuce, tomatos, onions, pickles, salsas, jalapenos, etc. Since I make my own burgers for BBQs I think I have set a pretty high bar on burgers, but these guys come just about as close as possible without being homemade. Basically I go there whenever I feel I can justify it to my stomach. They also have soups and salads, chili, dogs, fries...the kinds of things you would expect at a burger bar. They are good. I tried their chili once and it was really quite good. Last night my girlfriend had a chili cheese dog. We would have preferred smoked sausage over the traditional beef dog but it was good. They also appear to make their own deserts, though I have never had the room for any after the burger. The surroundings are very nice, but at this particular store they are very close to a theater multiplex and free structure parking, not to mention being right off the 280. Its a big place, and it appears to be all set up for parties. It seems to be sort of a 60s ambiance, whatever that means. I grew up in the 60s and there really wasn't anything like this then. That said I like it the atmosphere whatever you want to call it. Tables are campy and the ""napkins"" are rolls of paper towel."
5	pos	train	...The Server/bartender's name was Ron...attentive w/perfect timing...the Chef's name was Ray...the blackend Halibut was perfectly seasoned as was the Ceaser salad and boiled reds....wonderful meal...along with Ron and Ray's pleasing banter...very nice evening all around...
5	pos	train	While I was living in Japan, this was a usual Friday night out with my wife. The ramen here is absoluetly delicious, probably the best I had eaten in Yokohama, and if you know Japan, you know that Yokohama is the place for Ramen. We ordered the regular ramen and a kakuni ramen. The broth is thick and incredibly flavorful, the service is super-fast, and the prices are pretty much like any you'd pay anywhere else. It's a tiny little place, but they've always got jazz music playing on the speaker system, and the decor suggests they're trying to be a little more modern/fusion than other ramen places. For non-Japanese speakers, they have a picture plaquard outside which you can use to oorder what you want. Be ready for a wait sometimes, there's outside numbered seating. At any good Ramen shop, there's ALWAYS a wait. If you enjoy tonkotsu ramen (pork broth) then this is totally the place to go. I've heard there are other Nanashi locations around Yokohama, but I am not sure. http://www.nanashi.co.jp/
5	pos	train	Excellent, Excellent! For being in a rural northern atmosphere this restaurant was wonderful. EXCELLENT service, and a very attentive and pleasant staff!
5	pos	train	While visiting Orlando for a wedding, we stumbled upon this place after seeing a brochure at the Kennedy Space Center. We arrived at 5 p.m. and waited about a half-hour, but it was well worth it. The quality of the food was outstanding; the portions unbelievable. I had lobster (the entire lobster, not just the tail), crab legs (5 big ones), shrimp and scallops. My girlfriend had shrimp, scallops and a crab cake. With one drink and one dessert, the bill was less than $55. All the locals in the wedding also raved about the place. We liked it so much, we went back for lunch a few days later before going to the airport.
5	pos	train	Very enjoyable overall experience. They were very accomadating and the food was excellent.
5	pos	train	Being a vegetarian, this was heavenly for me. Between my friends and I, we had a little bit of everything, and the waiter was more than helpful in our decision process. I can't WAIT to go back to Asheville and take some of my other friends to this diamond in the rough!
5	pos	train	wonderful fresh fish beautiful decor Friendly service Resonable Prices
5	pos	train	I frequent this restaurant often. I believe it's the best in the Esplanade Center. I enjoy bringing friends here for lunch and dinner. I love their wine menu. I plan to return often. It's definitely worth a try. *CHEERS* ~X~
5	pos	train	My experience here overall was wonderful. The Restaurant was used for a Family Reunion and we used the back room for the gathering of 45-60 people . this was a group of people that had not been in the same place in well over 20+ years. Consisting of 4 Famillies 3-4 Generations and it was the most beautiful time all could have had . The Wait staff was very helpful and Courteous . I highly reccommend this Restaurant Thank YOu LaurieAnne
5	pos	train	This was not my first visit, nor will it be my last. Great food, great quality. The salads and soups are great, but the fresh baked, honey butter topped croissants are sinfully good!
5	pos	train	Excellent dining experience-the best food, creative, fresh and delicious, generous portions. Jerry, the chef, owner is very accommodating and eager to please. We have eaten there three times by ourselves (as a couple) and once with our best friends. We will return often.
5	pos	train	My wife and I had eaten at Victory Lane before at their sunday brunch. As we were more than happy with the experience, we decided to return for the sunday prime rib special. At $11.95, we couldn't believe the meal we were served. We started with a soup and both of us ordered the prime rib medium. When the main course arrived, it was perfect. I couldn't believe the size of the portion. It was a good size, trimmed of most fat and cooked to perfection. My wife ordered the mashed sweet potatoes and said that they were the best potatoes she ever ate. Both of us can't wait to go back.
5	pos	train	The food and service at this little family diner was exceptional. We will keep visinting this establishment... while u are there tell the waitresses jokes, they are awesome.
5	pos	train	Everyone enjoyed their meal and there was plenty to eat, no one went away hungry. We went on a late Saturday afternoon and sat right down. We made our movie in plenty of time! We are definitely going to try to make the Sunday prime rib special!
5	pos	train	We live in Illinois (originally from NJ) and whenever we ask the kids where they want to go eat they say Shady Maple! A little too far away to come there often but whenever we come home to NJ we make sure we stop at Shady Maple!
5	pos	train	Glowbal had excellent service and food. The atmospher is great for the younger crowd- very funky and happening. I have eaten there twice and will defintaly return.
5	pos	train	The best Spanish food in New York. I am from Spain and I had my 28th birthday there and we all had a great time. Salud!
5	pos	train	The Black Oak offers some of the best clam chowder north of San Francisco, in my honest opinion. Black Oak is a great place if you want have a decent meal at a reasonable price. If your traveling through Vacaville and need to take a break give Black Oak a try. I love stopping by and ordering the soup and sandwich off the menu. Did I mention it's in walking range to the Vacaville Factory Outlet.
5	pos	train	After reading the reviews, I was concerned. HOWEVER... I took my daughter, son-in-law, grandaughter and wife for lunch 2/27/04 at noon. The wait was nominal, and the hostes kept up appraised of our seating availability. We were seated in a wonderful booth toward the N/E corner of the restaurant. Immediately our drink order was taken and served. Then Tiffany, our waitress explained the family style menu, made some suggestions as to selections and was off w/ our order. In a very reasonable amount of time, our order was served, HOT, and quite plentiful for a Lunch menu. Several times Tiffany returned to check on our satisfaction. We could not have been happier. Part of customer treatment, is determined by the tone set by the customer. We found the Iron Wok to be a GREAT dining experience and would highly recommend it to everyone.
5	pos	train	fajitas are the best!!!
5	pos	train	I've not only eaten at the Chicken Pie Shop, I used to get it to take home. Sure miss now that I've moved to WA. Wish I could get them to open up a place up here or show me how to do it.
5	pos	train	Bonfish Grill one of a large number of restaurants in Florida and other states. The food was excellent. All members of my party enjoyed there meals. The Ahi Tuna was prepared exactly as ordered. The desert (creme brulee) was some of the best ever. The Bonefish Grill is not cheap but it offers excellent seafood and service.
5	pos	train	They had great food ,great service at a great price
5	pos	train	It was a very romantic atmosphere, and this was great because I went with my girlfriend. We accepted the special Italian wine recomendation, and we loved it! The place is romantically-dark, small candle lamps on the table, delicate decorations, soft northern italian music, truly a wonderful experience. The manager came out and greeted us at the end, we ended up getting some nice port on the house! Definitely will return!
5	pos	train	ToDai is a wonderful restaurant. The food is served buffet-style which creates a nice, casual atmosphere. Some people may think it is a bit pricey but for the amount of food that you get, it is well worth it. It is an all-you-can-eat Japanese buffet. I haven't been to other ToDai locations but so far the one in San Jose is by far my favorite. My family and I set days aside just to go. It's fun and it delicious.
5	pos	train	This restaurant is situated right on the water in Long Beach, near PCH. It's only open for breakfast and lunch, and I've dined there many times for both The food is always served hot and delicious by a friendly face. I've taken many friends to this place and have always had great service, and great food. For casual dining, breakfast or lunch, this place is the best! Review submitted by: Kerry Reed DeLine
5	pos	train	"Located in the ""Condesa"" zone (Mexico City's most 'a la mode zone) it's a place where the very owner ask you to sit at his table, a man who is a poet, a music composer and a ""torero"" (bull fighter). The atmosphere is of a taurine fashion, with a live romantic piano. The menu includes all types of food (international), but the speciallity is chicken. A good place to meet with important, artistic and political people and pass a good time."
5	pos	train	The outdoor ambiance is wonderful, the food is fantastic, the servers are friendly, the bartenders are generous! They are definitely doing something right at this restaurant, since it has been around for such a long time and has continuously been a pleasurable experience....
5	pos	train	"James Fisher,owner/manager greeted us at the door and made us feel welcome as if we were family. We loved the buffalo shrimp appetizer ,it was huge a portion with a really nice kick!!!! Lets start with dinner,I had the grilled salmon with a pistachio orange glaze and can honestly say that it was the best I've ever tasted.My girlfriend had the ""Jim Beam"" NY strip and it was tasty & cooked to perfection, medium/rare of course. Chef Larry checked on us as he made his rounds. The bar has a great atmoshere and strong pina colada's. James says there outdoor bar is opening soon and we can't wait to see it.. This is a place we'll be sure to frequent!!!!"
5	pos	train	Excellent service, our server was very attentive to all of our needs. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. The food was great and very fresh, with good prices. An overall good dining experience.
5	pos	train	Neighbor restaurant that serves seafood in shell form. It has a pizza parlor attached for the kids and a friendly atmosphere as a neighborhood bar. Drinks are cheap...martinis are only 4.00 and beer is cheap. Average meal runs about 10-14 dollars. I had lobster for 14.99 at 1.5 lbs. You won't go broke and you'll love the quality of the food. Remember you are going for shell food like the name nippers would indicate.
5	pos	train	"Almost entire staff Italian, we were seated in front of the open kitchen. The appetizer special that night was meatballs and sausage in red sauce. Now I grew up in South Philadelphia. Italians in So Philly call red sauce ""gravy"". This was the best gravy I had in 20 years. But the meatballs were outstanding, again I hadn't had meatballs this good since my ex girlfriend's grandmother used to make them over 20 years ago. Homemade sausage that was absolutely delightful. Baby eggplant appetizer was amazing. Lasagna out of this world, gnocchi with bolognese sauce ""bravo"". The service was truely amazing. Never did I have to ask for a single item; every single staff member was aware of every table, I have never seen such attention to detail in a busy busy restaurant, yet we felt as though it was such an intimate dining experience. Not cheap but worth every penny"
5	pos	train	my friends and I decided to this new japanese restaurant in downtown dallas next to purgatory night club. well let me tell you it blew me away when I first walked in. the atmosphere and decor was amazing, they had a samurai suit from the 1600's. the food and service was the best, we had a waiter that look like gohan from dragon ball z cartoon this guy was the best 5 star. the sushi was fresh and probably the best i've tasted in dallas. they even have a bar upstairs call the sake lounge.
5	pos	train	"As I am not from the Browns Mills area, I let my boyfriend select the restaurant we would be dining at for our fourth anniversary. When we pulled up to Riccardo's it was very misleading. I thought he had taken me to a pizzeria, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is much more to Riccardo's than great pizza! The nightly specials included fresh seafood and authentic Italian meals that franchises such as the ""olive garden"" couldn't come close to in price OR quality. The tables each had a candle and while it appeared very romantic, we opted to dine outside ( Dining area is surrounded by white fences with faux ivory climbing the sides and beautiful pavers on the ground) It was really charming, as was our waiter! Not only was our meal delicious, but the dessert tray was AMAZING! (and homemade!) Needless to say, I encourage everyone and anyone traveling through the area (or looking for somewhere new to dine) to try Riccardo's!"
5	pos	train	My wife and I have been to Veneto 3 times, and love it more each time. We used to be steadfast customers of Carraba's, but we have been permanently converted by the food, folks and great service at Veneto.
5	pos	train	I took someone to 6th & Main on a first date. We were treated like royalty. The service was excellent, the special filet was so tender it melted in your mouth. This place would be a find in Chicago or New York, but to find it in a small town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains is something else. It's worth the drive. You'll not regret it.
5	pos	train	"This restaurant serves Continental cuisine with a smidgen of saffron in most of the dishes. Dining is a delightful experience. All of the dishes , desserts and service deserve a ""Bravo""!"
5	pos	train	Of all the restaurants I've visited in the US and abroad, this is the best. The food is delicious (everything on the menu is outstanding), the ambiance is charming, warm and inviting and the owner-hostess makes the visitor feel like he/she is the most important diner she has ever had the opportunity to serve. I have returned to Cambria several times just to enjoy this experience again and again.
5	pos	train	The Grotto is amazing! I'd recommend it to anyone who isn't satisfied with a Big Mac. Nowhere has better Italian food! Do your tastebuds a favor. Treat them to the Grotto!
5	pos	train	The atmosphere, food, service...everything was fabulous! The food was so delicious. The waiter was very attentive. He made excellent suggestions to me and my husband (or we would have been there all day trying to choose!) They have many great selections, premium wine by the glass (Italian, French & American), and 2 patios for outdoor dining. It was very upscale yet casual. They made you feel at home. I can't wait to go again.
5	pos	train	We had a wonderful experience. I had the seafood enchiladas which were very good. And I also had the Mahi Mahi with pistachios on a different night. Both were excellent. But the steak was also excellent. I definitely plan on going back.
5	pos	train	We did the carry out thing instead of sit down. Service was good, prices were excellent. Good Pizza cooked just like we ordered. They do have Subs, Salads, Oven Baked Pasta and Desserts. Give it a try you will not be SORRY.
5	pos	train	The food is Fantastic along with the prices and the service. Josh, Chrissy and Angie are the BEST!!!! The crabcakes are out of this world along with the Black Angus steak.
5	pos	train	The best real italian outside of florence!
5	pos	train	Vegetable dishes are flavorful, yet not heavy with oil and cream like at many other Indian restaurants. The tandoori dishes are also good, too. And it's great fun to watch the chef at the tandoors, slapping naans against their walls. Service is friendly.
5	pos	train	1. The waitress was a pleasure to have. She made us laugh, yet she also did a great job and never forgot to bring anything. She was always there to see if we needed anything, and to keep our drinks and coffee filled. Review submitted by: Joanna Crowell 2. There are over 200 Waffle Houses in metro-Atlanta alone! They are wonderful places to eat! Very quick service, cheap food, wonderful experience overall! They're only in the South, so when y'all are down here, check one out!
5	pos	train	"To the Staff and Owners of Las Olas Cafe: The next time you walk into a restaurant, any restaurant really, look at the faces of the people seated, already eating. See what the overall expression is on their faces. I guarantee you that you will not find faces like the ones we observed when we were led through your dining room. When patrons are truly pleased with the food, surroundings, and service of a place, it shows in their faces. They are animated; hands are moving when they talk, smiles, laughter, joking. What an atmosphere to walk into. We eat out a lot, 3-4 days a week, we cook a lot at home. We know good food, we know superior food. You people have definitely surpassed any experience we have had in many, many years! WOW, that was the word we kept using throughout our dinner on Friday 3/7/03. The decor was brilliant, the fact that our water glasses were consistently filled, considering that we drink massive amounts of water, without asking was the first indication that we had found a unique place. Jon our waiter was knowledgeable regarding the menu, giving his personal recommendations as well as other guests response to some our your menu items. Jon was the true professional waiter, friendly, knew his menu, perfect timing of courses, yet he was not overbearing. Silverware was replaced when needed. Ubiquitous is the word for this type of service. He was always just within sight of our table, yet he did not ""lurk"" over us. Very cheerful, well dressed and groomed, a true professional in this age of casual service, what a surprise!! The fried green tomatoes with crab were just amazing, we were able to taste everything in this dish, the same for the blackened scallops, the fish soup was mind blowing, just the right amount of everything, and again we were able to taste it all, nothing too powerful. The Chicken Capriccio was excellent as well as the Walnut Crusted Mahi-Mahi. As I stated when I was there, I have been in the restaurant industry for over 25 years and I truly believe that I had the best meal of my life at your establishment!! I will visit as often as possible. My partner said that we were lucky we found Las Olas Cafe on the last night of our visit, otherwise we without a doubt would have been there every night of our vacation!!! While I sometimes am hesitant to tell other people about such a great find, I will tell everyone about your establishment, it too good to keep to ourselves!!!! Continue your superb work, both in the front of the house as well as in the back. You people have achieved what such a small percentage of other have; you found perfect balance in these two areas, and the smiles of the other patrons told us that as soon as we sat down. Thank you so much, Jack Barry, Jr. Philadelphia, PA March, 2003"
5	pos	train	This has been become our regular Sunday brunch stop. Everything, from the decadent caramel French toast, light-as-a-feather crepes filled with custard or fresh fruit, to the omelettes are super fresh and delicious. The French country decor is very welcoming and the staff always go out of their way to please. I have also tried lunch and the savory crepes, sandwiches and salads are filled with the freshest and most flavorful ingredients. We are hooked!
5	pos	train	My husband and I find it a great local bar & grille to have a fine dinner, quick bite and a nice brunch. I recommend that others give it a try.
5	pos	train	We went early, around 5, which was probably a wise thing to do. We had great service and all of the entrees and side dishes we ordered were excellent. Decor was lovely, nothing like your typical Chinese restaurant. Prices, obviously were higher, but worth it. Would definitely return.
5	pos	train	"The Mai Kai is ""The Best."" Not only is it the greatest remaining vintage tiki bar in the world, and not only is it the greatest Polynesian dance review on the mainland, not only are the gardens incredible and the items inside only surpassed in a few museums, and the service better than you ever had, BUT, the food is absolutely incredible. THE best Peking Duck we ever had by a long shot. Makes everything else hide in shame! A must if you are within an hour of the place. All drinks hand made fresh. An experience you will never forget."
5	pos	train	"Such attentive, friendly service. The food was delightful, a bit crowded, but great ambiance. I love the ""sexy"" drink specials they offer - such imaginative cocktails."
5	pos	train	I eat here all the time, it has to be my favorite restaurant. The food is outstanding, the service friendly and attentive, the view of the water is very relaxing and romantic
5	pos	train	What a surprise! My girlfriend and I were returning from the shore and thought about stopping for a quick meal before returning home. When we spotted Ricardo's pizzaria we pulled in. We planned on having a some slices or sandwiches until we saw the dining room and menu. We could not resist turning a quick stop into a dining experience. The choices on the menu were all irresistable. The atmosphere was great and believe it or not, the night we stopped by they ever had live entertainment. The waiter Sergio was top notch. He was courteous to a T and we ever decided to stay for dessert and coffee. We generally leave after dinner and not have dessert but we could not resist. This place must be one of Browns Mills best kept secrets. In the pizzaria part of the restaurant pizzas were being made non-stop for both pick up and delivery. You could hear the phone ringing constantly but it was not distracting. The delivery drivers were in and out delivering both pizzas and full dinners as well as sandwiches fresh from the ovens and grills. Hey Browns Mills, the world is going to find out about your secret. Hats off to Vito the owner. He greeted us during dinner and was the one that convinced us that we had to try the dessert menu.
5	pos	train	I love the food here! It has a great family environment! I will DEFINITELY GO BACK and if you are ever near ANY O'Charleys PLEASE STOP IN!!!!
5	pos	train	I can't believe the most famous name in steaks now has it's own restaurant!!! The steaks and food were soooooo wonderful and cooked to such perfection. As of today, I have eaten there on numerious occasions and have yet to had a bad experience let alone poor food quality. Their wine menu is the best too! Great live pianist on Th-Sat!
5	pos	train	Every dining experience has been wonderful. The admosphere and warmth of the host family cannot be beaten. Their seafood is always fresh and delicious as well as their unbeatable filet mignon. We have tried their specials and they truly are special. Cannot say enough about this restaurant!!!
5	pos	train	Good Food Looked busy when we first passed by. Looked like a good crowd just after lunch. Food was excellent. Waitress was a little slow but the quality of the food made up for it! Good Food and we will return.
5	pos	train	Panda North is THE best place for Chinese food in the Northeast. I go there at least twice a week and the food is ALWAYS amazing and the service is TOP NOTCH. I HIGHLY recommend their crab rangoons, their vegetable rolls, and their sesame chicken. They are my favorites and are to die for. Whatever it is that you decide to order, I know you will just love it. And the prices are unbeatable for the amount and quality of the food you get. :)
5	pos	train	Great atmosphere. Beautiful place and friendly staff. Highly recommended.
5	pos	train	The food, atmosphere, and service is excellent, and you are given nice large servings at a very reasonable price.
5	pos	train	Located just off I-5 Thirty Miles south of Oregon Border in Yreka, California the Black Bear Diner is a welcome break from all the bland food you find while traveling through the state. These small chains of diners are peppered throughout California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona. If I had to choose from a Denny's or a Black Bear Diner that decision would be a no brainier, Black Bear Diner would be the winner! Service was a little slow in this particular restaurant at least for the couple sitting directly across from our table, but they agreed this is one of the better roadside diners. The Black Bear Diner caters to children with a cool kids menu offering crayons and paper to color and draw pictures, a welcome break from a long road trip. Moreover, the price is right too!
5	pos	train	This was the best place that we ate at on vacation.The food was very good and there was a big selection to choose from.It was far better than we thought it would be.The steaks were as tender and flavorful as those served in many fancy steak houses,and they were unlimited! The hush puppies were the best that we have ever tasted!We just wish that Cactus Willies was located closer to where we live!
5	pos	train	I am a regular visitor to Boston from London England and while there I am always on the look out for interesting restaurants. I read about the Broadway Bistro in Revere in one of the local papers and decided to give it a try as it is very convenient from down town Boston. The atmosphere in the restaurant is cozy and friendly and I was made to feel right at home. I had one of the best Seafood Risotto's I have ever had including in Italy and a Veal Oscar which was exceptional. In addition to tasty meat it was topped with crab and asparagus. I will be going back without any doubt. George of London, England
5	pos	train	What a secret hide away in North Pasadena! Was there on weekend when they have live jazz. Excellent halibut and steaks, everything is under $20 bucks. The Equadorian Shrimp Ceviche is unlike anything I have had before - secret topping of popcorn. The wine list is unusual as it is fairly priced with a wide selections of wines from South America.
5	pos	train	Awesome place to eat and friendly service. I would return anytime. Tuesdays there is live music and you can't beat that. The food is great and the drinks are strong!!!
5	pos	train	It was a great experience. The people, food, and atmosphere was excellant. Great place for any event.
5	pos	train	We have had the pleasure of eating here on a number of occasions and it continues to be an equisite experience. The food is continually above par and the atmosphere and attention from the staff next to none. We were last there for a business meeting and I would recommend the wine room for any small gathering. It's a must go!
5	pos	train	Food was Great, Waitress was there and checked on us frequently....Ribs were tender I would return again and again.....
5	pos	train	great food ,great service GREAT EVERYTHING!!!!
5	pos	train	We eat at the world's finest restaurants and nobody does fish better than Mark Weber at Watermark. He is without a doubt one of the best chefs in the US.
5	pos	train	The food was tremendous. Chef Pierre applies French cooking techniques to northern game and exotic dishes. Caribou, Muskox and Arctic Char are specialties. The Fallow deer in a Bourbon Sauce was tender and delicious. The wine list is extensive with every region in France and most other wines regions in the world represented. A must visit for anyone who travels to Yellowknife.
5	pos	train	This is an off the beaten track place, located near Davidson College. We were impressed with the diverse menu both with the cooked items and the sushi items. The atmosphere is very vibrant, and very comfy. Food is great with creative sushi and Pan-Asian Fusion dishes from Southeast Asia and Japanese steakhouse entrees. The dessert menu is extensive and interestingly not found any where else, most of which are made from scratch.
5	pos	train	"For those who do not know, this was supposed to be a revival of a very old and loved Cleveland establishment, known for its unique ""brown sauce"". The sauce we recently had, billed as ""the original"", bore no resemblence to the original. Besides being the wrong color and flavor, it had the consistency of library paste. The bread appeared to be obtained from a supermarket shelf; the grated cheese was sparingly spooned onto our pasta and then whisked away. The busser stood next to our table and stared at us, waiting to swoop down on us, throughout our entire meal. To add insult to injury, we had to pay $2.00 to park in the restaurant's own lot."
5	pos	train	We vacation every fall for a week in Pennsylvania. Since we discovered the Village Farmer And Bakery about 6 years ago we have made it a highlight of our trip to stop by on the last day of our vacation for a breakfast of their donuts and to pick up one of their fresh raisin breads to have for the next day's breakfast. We usually leave Hazleton,Pa about 7AM and drive to the Delaware Water Gap exit of I-80. We ALWAYS arrive early and end up waiting outside their door for about a half hour with visions of their melt-in-your-mouth fresh-made donuts dancing in our heads!They are the absolute best donuts on Earth. We are surprised that the local police allow anyone within 5 miles of the place!This is a tiny,rustic farm market and bakery and doesn't look like much until you smell and TASTE their donuts!We found it by accident 6 years ago when we missed our exit and had to turn around and this was the BEST mistake that we ever made!Make the same mistake for yourself and you will not regret it!
5	pos	train	Oakwood Bistro is our favorite restaurant in the Kalamazoo area. We go there at least once a week, love the exquisite food and delightful service. We also take all of our friends there and they love it too.
5	pos	train	One of the best kept secrets in Arizona. A small family owned and operated Mediterranean restaurant. The food is always very fresh and the owners are extremely nice and generous. Great lemon garlic chicken, fresh squeezed lemonade and a big variety of vegitranien dishes and warps. Every thing is priced very reasonably since it's next to the ASU. Once you eat at Urban's you will want to go back every day.
5	pos	train	It was a great place can't wait to go back
5	pos	train	Dining at Rosalie's is like going to the Tuscan region of Italy. The wait staff is very efficient,friendly and knowledgeable. The menu selection is one that is truly different for this part of the country. There is also a bread bakery on the premises with crusty, delicious breads you can purchase to take home.
5	pos	train	"Had Lunch at NYD on a very busy wednesday....although they were busy my order took less then 15 min....service was friendly and everyone seemed to know each other...great ""BIG"" deli sandwich was too good not to finish....Fantastice Philly cheesstake and Real Italian Meatball sandwich, will try their NY PIzza Next time for sure....Great NY homemade cheesecake.....belive Wendy is the Owner and Chief Sandwich Maker..Don't miss this place, notice that the serve breakfast also...Hours are 9-6 M thru F...but they will open on weekends for Catering....."
5	pos	train	Went in this little restaurant twice. It's a great place, with a charming garden to eat in the back. The service was courteous, and the food was really good. A lot of spicy dishes for amateurs! Delicious spring roll appetizers.
5	pos	train	If you want a fine meal with lots of it, go to Dempseys. On the river in Petaluma, you can't go wrong. The food is nouveau California and some of the finest dining in Sonoma County. Caffe Giostra is another winner for Italian food.
5	pos	train	We eat here at least once a month. They have the best salsa in town and we have tried them all. Great service and wonderful food.
5	pos	train	Some friends and I ate dinner at chiarellas resturant this past month and our dining expierience was very pleasant. After recently being refered to the resturant ,And even after reading such a poor write up,I decided to visit chiarellas myself. Although it was very busy,and we did have about a 20 minute wait,while sitting at the bar,having a chocolate martini I thought the bartender was very friendly and she made a great martini!!! Our waiter was great,and I thought the service was impecable. my friend ordered the veal chop,the other orded veal parm,and I had a nice itialian breaded strip steak.We had didn't finish our dinners because they were such large portions,the bus boy packed everything nicely for us to go. Overall I would have to say that our dining experience was fabulous and we will definatally return.
5	pos	train	Very friendly and courtious staff. Food was excellent and prompt. Pricing very reasonable.
5	pos	train	This is a Great Italian restaurant with a very large menu selection that includes at least 20 entree selections each in veal, fowl, pasta, and seafood categories. The food is excellent and the portions are generous (expect to take home at least half of your meal even if you are a hearty eater). Victoria's also has an adequate wine list. The atmosphere was as Italian as the area has to offer and is upscale enough that you can feel comfortable in suit and tie or down to earth enough to wear blue jeans and sweatshirt. Victoria's is small enough for intimate dinners for two but large enough for large Italian family dinners. Victoria's has a full bar, excellent service, exquisite food, and delightful atmosphere. But, come early!! Victoria's is also a very popular spot. ENJOY!!
5	pos	train	Millbrae is not known as being a restaurant mecca in fact there are only a few restaurants in a town which has a population of just over 21 thousand people. Anabelle's is a welcome addition to the main drag. Anabelle's wait staff is pleasant and knowledgeable when it comes to the specials and work as a team so you get double the service since the wait staff shares the tips, so any server can help you when it's time to order. The day we visited Anabelle's Hob Nob Matt and Victor were hard at work trying to make everything perfect. Issac the Chef /dishwasher/owner stopped by our table to see if everything was ok and everything was! You must try the salmon!! At the posting of this review Anabelle's did not have a Liquor license however you are encouraged to bring your own wine the corkage fee is around $3.75. good food great service and a wonderful presentation.
5	pos	train	What a terrific restaurant. The food is plentiful and outstanding! The manager came by and introduced himself on the two occasions we visited. The bar has a piece of metal indented into it with frozen ice to keep your drinks cold. Very friendly and totally personal staff. Try the Bailey's Crepes or Bailey's Cheesecake, AWESOME!!!!!!!!
5	pos	train	My wife & I ordered Argentinean strip & tenderloin steaks. They were superb, tasty & tender. House margarita is great. Complimentary tortilla chips and salsa is served at beginning. Salsa is served in a single skimpy plate. Ask waiter to bring one for every person in your party so you don't have to reach across table and drip all over. Hand waiter your parking ticket when asking for check, and the fee will be deducted from your bill.
5	pos	train	This is my absolute favorite restaurant in the Chicago area. Despite being located within a casino, it is an easy place to get to. The casino provides valet parking and handicapped valet as well. The hostess has almost always been the same girl for the last 5 years+ and she is always accomidating and gracious. The dining room is immaculate and luxoriously appointed. White tablecloth all the way. Service is fantastic. The servers demonstrate immense respect for their customers, and try to speak to you by name. i.e. Mr. So n so is your party prepared to order? The menu is well devised, and ranges from pasta, steak and seafood dishes. The quality of the food is top notch. Details are paid attention to from start to finish. Costs run in the $40-50 per person range including drinks. But if you gamble in the casino you can often get the meal for free. (as I always do) I enjoy dining here about once a month. Its a great place.
5	pos	train	What a fabulous meal. Top notch food....and the staff was like a nanny to our 3 year old.....had a maui onion crusted ahi that could be the best thing I've ever had.....my wife had the pork chop which could be the 2nd best thing I've had....no view of the ocean but with food this good (and eating while it was dark) who cares?
5	pos	train	From the moment we were seated and given menus, we knew this would not be a typical evening. The choices were varied and extremely tempting and that was before Alex, our waiter, told us of the specials. The cuisine is very international, but leans toward Swiss, French, German with a bit of Asian thrown in. The fish selection was superb and the preparation 'blurb' had us salivating. The whole evening was so special, we went back again the next night and would have gone back a third evening had they not been closed on Sunday! The sauces are savory and light and exactly compliment the dishes. Hot foods were hot and cold foods were cold. The Cream of Broccoli soup with cheese had me in 'heaven'! Reservations are suggested, but because we were there off season, not totally necessary. I can not say enough to praise the kitchen and the staff.
5	pos	train	A Modern New restaurant on Restaurant Row. This place has Italian food that is out of this world,the service is great and the ambiance of the restaurant is just perfect. A true hot spot to go to before or after a broadway show. I trully recomend this new gem on Restaurant Row...
5	pos	train	"We go here pretty often since it is pretty close by, plus we love our sushi chef ""Eddie"" - we secretly call him Eddie the Lover. lol Their sushi tastes really good and the taste and service is very consistent. I usually order the seaweed salad, unagi roll, baked green mussel and hot green tea, plus an iced tea. By the time I am finished with my meal my green tea is cool enough for me to sip. My fiance, Marc, is not a big sushi eater and only gets two spider rolls and a coke - every time. His palate is not very adventurous. The prices are very good and the staff very friendly, as I have found most sushi bars to be. The sushi bar is quite large btw. The average meal for us is about $40. but I am a pig. I once split a bottle of cold ginger-flavored sake ($15.00) with Eddie, and it took me by surprise how strong it was. I exclaimed, I can't feel my face!! and told him he was trying to get me drunk. lol If you ever go and sit at the bar, ask for Eddie and he will take really good care of you and keep you laughing."
5	pos	train	Excellent food and service. Chef Kevin did an outstanding job in preparing a variety of different entrees.
5	pos	train	The restaurant is great. the atmosphere is a lot of fun, there is an open oven where they grill chicken in and other specialties requiring a flame broil. The cornbread is the best I have ever had, it is cooked and served in a skillet, magnificent! Everything I have eaten there is wonderful, and they serve a great Cosmopolitan!
5	pos	train	We live in Wichita, KS and drive to Tulsa just for the food at Shogun! We love the entire staff, they always go out of her way to make our 3 children feel so special. The best thing on the menu is the Royal Combination with a shrimp appetizer!! Thanks for the fun!
5	pos	train	We ate outside on the patio, it had a carribean feel with its white sand and rustic brick walkways. The food was delicious! I had the mingo mango tango. Can I just say YUMMY! As an apitizer or teazer as they called it we had the bamboo stick. I think this has to be the best resturant in Paducah.
5	pos	train	Casanova is the French restaurant within the Sans Souci Resort in Ochio Rios Jamaica. Theyoung chef John Cadieux (trained in Ottawa Canada) is a master. The food is wonderful and the presentation is superb. To dine at Casanova is to experience the very best! I would return to this restaurant in a heat beat. If you go to this restaurant - ask for the Chef's choice - John will come to your table and make suggestions - and cook you a dinner to remember.
5	pos	train	"Carrabba's is the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to. My wife and I love Italian food and Carrabba's really knows how to do it up right. Highly recommended. If you like chicken try the ""Chicken Trio"", it's a sampler of the Chicken Bryon, the Polo Rosa Maria, and the Chicken Marsala. Lovely!! PS. The reason the atmosphere gets a 4 from me is because they have a smoking section. Yes I hate the smell of smoke, especially while I am dining."
5	pos	train	What a place! My wife and another couple ate there recently. One of my coworkers recommeded Twigs for a true, fine dining mountain experience. Everything was amazing; service, food, the people! We ended up staying for 4 hours. Afterward, we went to their bar, which has a fireplace and wooden chairs. It was just perfect and cozy!! We will return!
5	pos	train	This is the best kept secret in Springfield! We have been to this one numerous times and have never waited in line. The ribs here are the best ribs I have found in the Eastern US, bar none!! Try their loaded baked potato with them. It's a true eating experience!!! (This is the former Red River Roadhouse.)
5	pos	train	We went for brunch and it was wonderfull. Have also had dinner there previously, great food, great atmosphere!
5	pos	train	This is a fun relaxed place to eat, the people who work there are always pleasant and helpful. We go there often. We love that we can order food to go and they can bring it out to your car and pay then. great....
5	pos	train	Overall my dining experience was once again to die for. I always enjoy the food and service. Thats what keeps me coming back for more...the food has something to do with that too. The only bad thing I have to say about my visit on April 6th, 2005 is that my sushi order took anywhere from thirty to fourty five minutes to get to my date and I. I will be returning to eat here for many years to come.
5	pos	train	Fantastic sandwiches and soups. A great value with first-quality ingredients. Staff is friendly and courteous and the little courtyard out front is adorable. An excellent choice for lunch on the road!
5	pos	train	Great place to go. Great atmosphere and great food.
5	pos	train	The Log House, located on Route 44 between New Hartford and Winsted CT, is a family-oriented restaurant in business for many years, and justly so. The menu offers everything from pot roast to prime rib, fish and chips to broiled fresh scallops. On weekends, home made banana cream, chocolate, and fruit pies (if you have room). Sunday breakfast buffet. Not your gourmet pricey menu, nor a wine cellar you'd be proud of, but a great place for a good meal if you're in Northwest hills of Connecticut. The locals' restaurant--always busy--always good, that won't break your budget. Try 'em--you'll be glad you did.
5	pos	train	It was a blast. The chefs were so much fun. The fish melted in my mouth like butter. Everything was delicious. I highly recomend it if you want great food, great service and lots of people and celebrity watching. Cool spot!
5	pos	train	Excellent and enjoyable.
5	pos	train	This place has spectacular Food. The Chicken Saltimbocca is to die for. Very tasty. Everything on the Menu is excellent and the owner is very friendly and mingles with the customers.
5	pos	train	Great cool young steakhouse, great outside dining, large banquet rooms.
5	pos	train	I love Todai's !!! Will return again and again.
5	pos	train	This excellent restaurant served us superbly, beginning with the host all the way to the management even working hard to make us even more satisfied than we all ready were.
5	pos	train	This place is GREAT. the humus and sauces are A++. ask for the hot sauce, the owner will make you some. if you are looking for good fresh healthy food this is th place. i eat there ALL the time.
5	pos	train	"Emeril Lagasse's first restaurant in Florida. You MUST make reservations at least 3 months in advance if you would like to dine prior to 9 pm. All of the food preparations are superior. Each entree has at least 2-3 sauces/garnishes that make for a great presentation. The restaurant's signature dish is the Andouille Encrusted Red Fish- not to be missed. This restaurant offers a tasting menu which is a good choice for the undecided ""foodie"". Wine list is EXTENSIVE and wins many awards, however, for novice wine drinkers, it is tough to find a bottle under $35. All in all, an establishment not to be missed."
5	pos	train	Had the coconut shrimp! The best! Great service too.
5	pos	train	I went to Magnolias with three friends on Friday night. We decided to try it after hearing good things about it since it re-opened under new management. We couldn't be happier with the experience. The food was excellent, and very reasonably priced, considering what they could charge for food of such high quality. Everything was fresh and made from scratch. In my opinion, the search is over for quality food in Orange Park!
5	pos	train	For a college town, this place was an uptown experience. The BEST food I've ever tasted and the chef is the famous previous personal cook for the Rolling Stones! If you want to impress a girl...this is the place to spend your parent's money on her!!!! Afterall... I did say this is a college town!
5	pos	train	We always go to Laporta's for just a nice dinner out or a special occasion. The Monday and Tuesday specials are wonderful, not to mention the jazz band.
5	pos	train	Great Food+Great Decor+Great Mariachi band=Great Atmosphere.
5	pos	train	The place has top-notch food and service. It looks like it is straight out of new York 1946. Check out the web site www.fhaz.com/redendos
5	pos	train	Sometimes its worth trying a new place. We were so glad we did. It was a great night in a great city. Food was excellent.
5	pos	train	"My boss and I ate at the bar. I ordered a filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection. Our bartender/waitress was quite friendly and described the restaurant as having a ""family"" atmosphere between staff and diners. Restaurant was upscale but not pretentious. A fun place to eat some really good food."
5	pos	train	I at the Bubba Gump restaurant on the Navy Pier in Chicago. It was a good time. The coconut shrimp was delicious. I was by myself and they treated me well. The waiter was from Ireland and we discussed Irish bars in Chicago.
5	pos	train	We got off the hi-way looking for a place to eat and stumbled on the Georgia Pig. It was raining, and the place looked like a dump, but we were hungry. It turned out to be the best ribs in the US. We're from Canada, and every time we visit Florida, we plan to go to the Georgia Pig to eat. We recommend it to all the Canadian snowbirds!!
5	pos	train	This Restaurant has the best Mexican food I've tasted in the area. The portions are huge and the prices are exceptionally low. They have GREAT margaritas!!! I'll definitely be back to try more things on the menu.
5	pos	train	"Don't miss this wonderrful dining/cultrual experience. Most recently my husband and I recommended it for the ""special dinner"" highlight of our family reunion vacation. There were 17 of us--many teeneagers--who enjoyed the classic flamenco dancing and a stellar dinner. The paella is wonderful (I had the chicken); the Cuban bread melts in your mouth; the signature ""1905 Salad"" is flavorful and memorable. Even the kids were ""wow'ed"" at the whole experience. Our service was ever-so-slightly slow (okay for a leisurely dinner, anyhow), and of course organizing checks for 17 people in 4 families was a little complicated. But if you're ready for a delicious, fun, memory-making dinner event, and are prepared to pay a little more for it, don't miss Columbia Restauant. Worth it, worth it, worth it!"
5	pos	train	The food is excellent, but the pad thai taste similar to another restaurant? But anyways from reading the first review i had to see for myself if it was true and I will tell you first hand that it is b.s. So if you are in new haven and want to eat some awesome authentic thai food give it a shot.
5	pos	train	The best experience ever... The service was great, the food was good and the band was wonderful. I didn't feel this kind of energy in months! I recommend it to my friends and whomever want to have the greatest time.
5	pos	train	From high school on, Baristas has been a favorite place for my friends and I to spend some time. Now in my third year of college, I still make a point to go get a cup of coffee every time I'm home for a weekend. And when my friends are in town too...well, the good times roll as we sit at table and laugh it up.
5	pos	train	Warm cozy atmosphere and food that is excellent with the homemade wheatberry bread and homemade soups being the ticket to bring you back.
5	pos	train	My family and I enjoy dining at this establishment, we always get great service and delicious food. I would really recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to experience a good time while endulging all their senses!
5	pos	train	Island Sushi is one of the many all you can eat sushi bars in the Reno area. It has the best selection of various types of sushi including an enormous selection of long rolls. The menu available for the all you can eat is very extensive. The price was typical for all you can eat sushi 18.95 (no time limit). The sushi chefs will also prepare any special requests. This is the best of the all you can eat sushi bars in Reno. Other good all you can eat sushi bars that are good are Sushi Club and Kokopelli's.
5	pos	train	My dining experience at Southside Bistro was by far the best I've had in Anchorage. From the moment we entered, we noted the extremely well-trained and friendly staff, the well-planned atmosphere, and the delicious smell of the cuisine. We were greeted warmly, as if we'd been there many times. Only a few moments went by before we were personall greeted by Jens, the owner. The food was fabulous, and the presentation was perfect. Thanks, Jens, for making a special occasion even more special.
5	pos	train	"If you on a budget but still want great food, this is the place for you. For a real treat try the ""Dumpling and Won Ton in Soup"", the service is always just right, I love returning for a new treat by trying something new. This has to be some of the beat chinese food to be found in San francisco!"
5	pos	train	We have been there many times and had a wonderful experience every time! Delicious food, fare prices. Food was always prompt. I highly recommend this place.
5	pos	train	This is a small sushi house with three great sushi chefs. Jimmy, one of the chefs, is a great comedian. Someone wrote this is Sashimi Heaven and indeed it is. This is the only place I can now eat Sashimi at. They have ruined me for other places. I highly recommend it.
5	pos	train	great food ,fun , great service,waiter was very attentive and made perfect menu selections for us when we requested suggestions
5	pos	train	This is a little coffee house (literally) on the Corner of Highway 50 and Junction. It serves the usual espresso drinks, while at the same time featuring new crations of its own. The baked goods are by a local woman and are out of this world. Worth a stop just for the pastries. After your order is made (and they are fast) you can take your drinks and pastries into the living room or the library, settle into a comfy couch or meet with friends out on the patio. A good time was had by all!
5	pos	train	We really enjoyed our dining experience at California Pizza Kitchen. The food was very fresh and full of flavor. Our server was able to provide detailed information about various menu selections which made us feel more comfortable with our selections. The dining room was alive with color and the aroma of the food being made filled the air and tempted our tummies! We'll be back.
5	pos	train	This is another place in Denver that I would go to. It is a resturant, bar, game room, pool hall, catering place all in one. Frontpart is set up for reservations very nicely done. When the group is done eating away goes the dishes and the top part of the table to reveal a pooltable. Has 3 sections for pool with 5 or so talbes. Center up a few step and into the bar area..back booths for eating and game room for all (video type) Grat family place. waiterss was very nice and helpfull..no rush for anything... while meat or snack is being prepared kids can go play some games instead of getting antsy at the table. We spent about 4 hrs there enjoying everything there. No it did not take that long to get the food it was so relaxing you do not want to leave. One is Downtown Denver and the other is in Westminster, just north of Denver, both places are great
5	pos	train	"Not fine dining but a fun place to eat. The walls are lined with items from the ""Daniel Boone"" TV Show. Some antiques are also on the walls. The burgers were excellent and the fries were done to perfection. Beans on the bar. And a southern delight ""Bluebell"" icecream."
5	pos	train	Well the best I can describe it is to read the Gwinnett Citizen Review: by The Gwinnett Citizen: Dining...with Sweet T. By Terry and Lynne Mays Fine Dining in Flowery Branch There is treasure in Flowery Branch, in the form of a restaurant called The Yacht Club. Located at the end of the quaint downtown area, this new place is a delightful mix of experiences. Outside, the home is the quintessential southern dollhouse, with its wrap-around porch and big shade trees. Inside, the picture of a beachside bistro, complete with cool jazz tunes and seaside paintings. Owners Jeff and Alina Hills have created an establishment which is not only a pleasure for their guests, but also seems to be a great joy for them. Dressed casually, they greet each diner with a handshake and the genuine impression that they are thrilled at their good fortune for having met you and your family. Smiling and moving comfortably around the dining room, the Hills seem to be a couple having a really good time at their own party. Our server, the lovely and efficient Jennifer, enticed us into trying a number of the specials offered that evening. We started with crawfish tails, nicely cooked, not overdone, covered in a sweet-smoky bar-b-que sauce, drizzled with a garlic aioli. Steamed Mussels Fume Blanc followed. These are a regular menu item, served with shallots, fresh thyme, spinach, and garlic mayo saffron croutons. The sauce, we found, is positively addicting and can be finished off with the thinly-sliced crusty bread provided. Each appetizer is enormous; plenty to be shared by two to four people. At Jennifers suggestion, we tried the Lobster Bisque. Served with chunks of lobster and drizzled with fresh cream and cognac, this soup is a favorite of regulars who rejoiced when it returned to the menu after a short absence last year. The specials are based on whats best in season. The owners purchase only a few pounds of each offering a night, guaranteeing freshness, and an original experience each time you visit. We enjoyed Grilled Ancho-rubbed Shrimp with jasmine rice, salsa verde, and celery root slaw, as well as Pan-seared Pompano encrusted in polenta and served on a bed of duck confit mashed potatoes and steamed artichoke. Sadly, we had not saved room for dessert. The menu lists many tempting treats including Creme Brulee, Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble with Ginger and cinnamon ice cream, and Profiteroles stuffed with Hazelnut Gelato and topped with chocolate and caramel sauces. The confections that were served around us were beautifully artistic, and, judging from the cleaned plates returning to the kitchen, delicious. The Yacht Club boasts a large selection of wines, in all denominations. Rather than trying to choose one for ourselves, we elected to leave that to Jeff, who selected a breathtaking Chardonnay from a vineyard he was featuring that night. Wines are a strong suit of this restaurateur, who hosts a special wine evening one Monday a month. The event in March was to highlight wines of a particular Sonoma County, California vineyard, with matching delicacies from the kitchen. Another original twist to fine dining is this restaurants Chefs Table. Call and arrange for the Hills and Executive Chef, Jack Hunt, to choose the entire experience for you, from the entrees to the wines, in the private dining room. It is perfect for that special anniversary or birthday dinner. We have yet to take this adventure ourselves, but can say that we would do so without the least trepidation. Chef Hunt, though he looks barely old enough to drive, is a talented, experienced artist who provided us with a masterful meal. Trained and practiced all over the United States, it is our great blessing that he found his way to this area. After we paid our check, we had the opportunity to meet the Hills and talk to them about The Yacht Club and their experiences in the ten months theyve been open. Our customers are our family, said Jeff, They support us and talk to us about whats going on with their day. Indeed, the place did seem to be populated, in part, by regulars who rave about their experiences and, at the same time, seem scared to death that the word will get out and The Yacht Club will become popular. No longer Flowery Branchs best kept secret, The Yacht Club is a winner. The Hills have brought personality back to the dining experience uniting great food, comfortable surroundings, groovy tunes, and an attitude that says, quite distinctly, Welcome! The Yacht Club, 5510 Church Street. Flowery Branch, GA 30542. 770.967.9060. www.fbyachtclub.com Scale: (1-10) Food: 10 Atmosphere: 10 Overall: pricey, but worth it!
5	pos	train	Great!!! the price was low the meal was large. I had a hamburger. the best I ever had. Good ole fashion taste, juicy and the buns were toasted. I wil return.l
5	pos	train	"Looked around at a few bakeries in Feb 2004 for a cake for a reception. Some recommended places were underwhelming. One of my wife's co-workers at gotten a cake here (Opera cake) that co-workers loved. So we ordered a tiramisu for 50-70 people. Price very reasonable. When we picked it up, we were stunned. Absolutely gorgeous cake. The guests at our event loved it (it was the best tiramisu we've ever had), and even catering staff said it was one of the best tiramisu they''ve ever seen/tasted. This place doesn't appear on any of the top ten lists I've seen in newspapers/magazines, and I don't think it's big with the ""in"" crowd, but the cakes are terrific. As soon as you walk in the door and look at what they have I think you'll agree."
5	pos	train	Great food and service.!
5	pos	train	Pizza Schmizza originated in Portland Oregon and has since opened restaraunts in the Seattle area. Thank goodness! Portland was a long way to go for a good slice!. I highly recommend them, the pizza is great, the service is friendly, and the decor is unique. Located on Southcenter Parkway
5	pos	train	Very good place to eat. Good menu. I had the filet, it was a good cut and cooked nicely. Good deserts as well. Interesting atmosphere in an old home. Very nice restaurant.
5	pos	train	This place has very good service.Take-out service and delivered is quick and fast
5	pos	train	Family type atmosphere, friendly place
5	pos	train	I have traveled a great deal, and was so proud to take my dearest friend to this restaurant after the opera. It was a better experience than the opera!! The service was impeccable. The waiters were attentive, without being obtrusive, the management was always watching - but not overtly so. The food was absolutely fantastic. Quiet, lovely, perfect.
5	pos	train	Quite frankly, it has to the best dining experience I have had in a long time. we had a large party and I was worried the service wouldn't be up to par, but was pleasantly wrong
5	pos	train	Finally after an exhaustive search I have found the best Philadelphia style Cheesesteak in Northern California! So many times have I been disappointed, driving for hours just to sample what was advertised as a Philadelphia Cheesesteak, only to find out someone failed to do their research. From the start Jerseys Tavern made me feel like I was on the east coast, with its vintage cash register and wooden bench style seating not to mention all the sports paraphernalia throughout the Sports Bar. The real highlight was the Jersey Cheesesteak which according to the cook is their most popular sandwich. While Jerseys is no Geno's or Jim's its pretty darn close. I also tried the Combo Cheesesteak which included mushrooms and bell peppers (I think the bell peppers are a California addition) However, I think the next time I will stick to the plain Jersey Cheesesteak. If your are a Philadelphia Eagles fan then you need to head over to Jerseys, watch the games on their wide screen TVs and say hello to Bob behind the bar for me. My only complaint, the Cheesesteak only comes in one size, although they do give you tons of meat so I guess that make up for the size. I will be back!
5	pos	train	It's a great whole in the wall place! My favorite in San Francisco! Great prices. And I love the food.
5	pos	train	This is the absolute BEST BBQ you will have.....ANYWHERE. It's slow cooked and best of all, it's all you can eat. They're only open four days a week and when they run out of something, they're out for the day. If your just visiting Peoria, you MUST get to the Q....it's THAT good!
5	pos	train	One of the best experiences that I have ever had. I had read the review on New York Bryan's in the Long Beach Press-Telegram, and Al Rudis the food critic made the food sound amazing. Al recommended the 4-Cheese Ravioli with Cabernet Soaked Raisins, and I had to try it. It was amazing, my guests enjoyed there dishes, the Chicken Marsala, the Chicken Picatta and the Lasagna, we ate and ate, the portions were huge the service was excellent. We stayed all night and then enjoyed there Monday Night Comedy, it was one of the best experiences I ever had and I intend to go back many times.
5	pos	train	Great place to meet with friends. The food is excellent and plentiful at a reasonable price. Teh employees are allways pleasant, and the atmoshpere is great.
5	pos	train	"In a city that has more restaurants per capita than any other in the United States, Chow is a casual gem where I've eaten often and always enjoyed an amazing meal. When it comes to the restaurant business, location isn't everything - several establishments failed at this Upper Market site, on the edge of the Castro, but Chow has continued to thrive since it opened several years ago, becoming a favorite meeting place for neighborhood residents. Dark, polished wood, constantly changing artwork (by locals, and usually for sale), fresh flowers, period light fixtures, and high ceilings provide a feeling of comfort. An outdoor patio is in use during periods of good weather. It's difficult to label the cuisine here, other than ""eclectic,"" as it combines flavors from a variety of sources, particularly Asia and Italy. The menu offers daily sandwich specials, excellent soups and outstanding appetizers (the steamed clams in a garlic-infused broth are a meal unto themselves), salads (including what is possibly the best Caesar anywhere, available with grilled chicken as a main course), pasta, interesting varieties of wood-fired pizza, grilled and roasted poultry and meats, and amazing desserts. The wait staff looks for the most part like it commutes from the Haight (lots of day-glo dyed hair, tattoos, and piercings on display), but they're all laid back and very friendly. The restaurant features a long antique bar where you can enjoy an imported cold brew, selected from seven on tap, big bottles of imported beer from Ireland and France, or a dozen or so small bottle brands. There's an extensive wine list, and all are available by the glass or bottle. What truly distinguishes Chow, aside from the fact that everything is fresh and creatively prepared, are the incredibly low prices, with most entrees less than $15, and several cheaper than $10. No reservations accepted; expect a long wait at peak dining hours. Because of the layout, it's impossible to linger at the bar while waiting to be seated. Those who opt to hang out in the adjacent (gay) bar will be summoned by the host or hostess when a table is ready. Leave the car at home - as in most San Francisco neighborhoods, street parking is nearly impossible. Fortunately, both MUNI and the classic streetcar line stop right at the corner. Try this one and you'll become a regular, guaranteed."
5	pos	train	From the saffron hued walls to the aubergine ceiling, the new Naan -N- Curry in Renton is truly a remarkable experience and undoubtedly the best Indian/Pakistani food I have tasted in the state of Washington. The sweet scent of tandoori spices greets you as you enter the front door, as well as the warmth generated from the constantly working clay ovens. You take a seat wherever you want and someone is there instantly with water and menus. After you have placed your order you can enjoy the chefs at work via a window into the kitchen that allows patrons to view the kabobs and Naan being made. About ten minutes later your food arrives hot and fresh at your table. You find your hunger has grown while you have been waiting, a direct result of the delicious aromas wafting throughout. Then you take that first bite and experience the explosion of flavors that dance across your tongue and you know you have found the real thing. When the check arrives you realize you have died and gone to heaven. We had three dishes, Pakora, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Korma, Naan and rice and the total was under $20.00. They even provided a to-go box for the leftovers.
5	pos	train	Tunnicliff's Tavern has been in existance for over 200 years, and it is easy to see why. Located right across the street from DC's famous Eastern Market, Tunnicliff's offers great food at great prices (they specialize in excellent Cajun dishes.) On warm evenings, it is pleasant to take advantage of their outside seating, and on weekends when Eastern Market is open, one can have a great meal here after a day of shopping for fresh produce and loveable flea-market stuff. Recently, they remodeled, giving the place a shiny new look to replace the old, almost decrepit look it had had previously. For the love of all things sacred, try the gumbo!!!
5	pos	train	Great place to eat!! Great food that is tasty! Very friendly staff.
5	pos	train	Rum Runners is without a doubt the best place to go for a great time. You can't get better staff, meet better people, or hear a better live music. If you haven't been there, you are missing out on the best time ever!!
5	pos	train	If I could sum up the experience in one word it would have to be excellent! If you want to visit a real southern restaurant with all the trimmings then head over to Johnny Reb's in Long Beach. I was greeted promptly and seated quickly, Courtney my server was very attentive always checking to see if I was happy. The menu has everything from baby-back rib's, fried green tomatoes, hush-puppies and blackened prime rib. I had the breakfast on the day I visited I requested my bacon to be extra crispy although it wasn't as crisp as I would have preferred, the smoked flavor more than made up for everything else. Johnny Reb's is was a wonderful experience for a city slicker like myself. Note to self next time while visiting Long Beach I must make plans to dine at Johnny Reb's again!
5	pos	train	It was good we've been to another mexican restaurants but this was the #1 restaurant. The food is good specially fajitas.
5	pos	train	Another great night!! We sat at the bar while waiting for a table upstairs, the bartender recommended the Little Boomey Shiraz, new from Australia, fantastic recommendation. Upstairs we started off with our waiters suggestions, the Tuna Sashimi & Tri o of Tartar. We had to order another Sashimi & requested extra Vegetable Tempura with it since all 5 of us couldn't get enough of it. I told our waiter the chef should put a plate of the Tempura on the menu since it was so amazing. We all ordered entrees, the Salmon was to perfection. My sisters Rack of Lamb was so good I will return to have it. Our waiter kept us very entertained, he was so funny.
5	pos	train	I am writing in regards to my previous experience at Yen Yen in which I found a bug in my food. Since this situation occurred and had been verified by we8there.com, the owner of Yen Yen Restaurant has contacted me directly. He was extremely sorry for the situation that has occurred and has given us a $30.00 credit. We can either pick up the $30.00 cash or use it towards another order. I appreciate the effort that the owner has gone through to rectify the situation, not many places would do that. Please remove the previous posting regarding Yen Yen - they really do care about their customers and accidents can happen. Thank you!
5	pos	train	I live in Hutchinson and worked at the Anchor Inn from 1982-1986. However, I try and eat there at least twice a month. It has the greatest food and the owners travel to Mexico quite a bit so know their dishes and what American's like in Mexican foods. I've also seen it listed in several travel books, and I know why - it is the best!
5	pos	train	It was St. Patrick's Day and the special was all-you-can-eat Corned Beef & Cabbage! I have had a lot of corned beef over the years, but this was the best tasting. It was sliced thick and had the texture of a slow-cooked roast beef that melted in your mouth! We paired it with the Chumeia Viognier and I was pleasantly shocked at how well the two complimented each other. All four of us had seconds, but we still had room to share four of Max's desserts around the table. We all agreed that we should make this our annual outing for St. Pat's Day!
5	pos	train	its probably the best resturant in memphis as i see it.
5	pos	train	The most authentic mexican dining experience in town :). Great service, friendly staff.
5	pos	train	I have lunch and dinner at Jaxon's several times each month and have found that I am always impressed with the food, service and everything else. I take relatives and visitors to Jaxon's when they fly into town. It is excellent.
5	pos	train	The food is absolutely delicious, definitely one of my favorite places to eat! Pricing is fairly decent.
5	pos	train	I went at lunch time and I ordered a piece of pizza and a salad. When the person called my number I was in shock at how big the slice of pizza was. It tasted sooo good and I loved the garlic they put on it. The salad was unbelievable. I loved their Italian dressing. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza and salad!
5	pos	train	My date and I decided to travel to the jersey shore and we stumled upon Riccardo's Pizza and Italian Eatery. Upon our entry we walked through a pizza area. We took notice of what we thought was a pizzeria . WOW were we mistaken. When we walked into the dining roon we noticed granite floors and marble walls. The side walls were all done in murals done by a local artist depicting a Sicilian setting. There was also a Authentic espresso and cappuccino bar along with allll! the Torani syrups for the coffees! (The owner went to great lenghts to decorate this place). We ordered from the Chef's Specials and our waiter was very good and well informed. We asked to speak to the chef and he came out immedietly. Althogh very busy he came out of the kitchen looking more like an actor or model than a chef . He had an arroagant look but was very cherming and answered all our questions. We orderd thecollasal shrimp ala Vito (the chef's name and the veal wich was stuffed with lobster and crabmeat both were excellent!!!!! What can i say so was dessert wich is made homemade!! So next time your in Browns Mills and driving to the shore or at the N.J cranberry festival make sure to stop by Riccardo's ....you'll be surprised at the incredible food and possibly one of the best chef's and best kept secret in NJ!!!!!!! BUON APETITO!!
5	pos	train	This is mine and my husband's favorite local restaurant for occasional casual outing when we're in the mood for extremely good food. Everything that either of us have ordered from the menu has been unexpectedly outstanding, fresh and impressive. The service is always VERY good, but occasionally it goes above and beyond with the little personal touches that make you remember your visit and want to come back. The atmosphere is nice and comfortable. If I had to come up with a complaint, I guess it would be that when large groups are parties are seated in the same room with regular diners, they do tend to become quite distracting, especially if children are present. But once your dinner arrives, I can guarantee you won't be thinking of anything but savoring every bite.
5	pos	train	4FIFTY5 can compete with some of the finer restaurants in Manhattan. It is one of the best restaurants that I have been to in New Jersey & I have been to a lot. Tony
5	pos	train	I have eaten here twice in the last month. The jazzy atmosphere and decor made my dates especially pleasant. The last visit, my date and I had apple martinis and the crab cake appetizer. The martinis are superb. And the crab cakes were incredible. The staff are fun and friendly. My boyfriend and I have decided to make this our First Friday restaurant that we will frequent each month.
5	pos	train	An absolutely outstanding value with fantastic Italian food. We had the eggplant parmigiane and it was the best I have had while travelling in Canada. This is a family run operation with the owner looking over each detail. Great children's menu as well. I loved it!!
5	pos	train	"If you like bbq, and you like your bbq Texas style (not so hot it removes the first 3 layers of skin from inside your mouth!) or Memphis style (pretty much the same), you'll love Armadillo Willy's. It's hard to drive down San Antonio past El Camino in that Los Altos/Mt. View/Palo Alto 3 corners area w/o turning into the parking lot once you smell the oak wood fires buring. Like beef, try the 18 hour slow cooked Texas brisquet. My favorite (and I've had about all they offer) is the Memphis style pork (sometimes called ""pull pork""). That's also the best deal in the house as you get a huge plate full of pork!!! Or you can try the multi-meat combo. Someone at the table tonight had the prime rib and she said she'd do it again... especially if you can fanagle an end cut... smoke 'n all, y'know! They've slightly changed the peanut coleslaw recipe and that was a little dissappointment, but sitll preferable over any other salad. I heartily recommend them, and if you're looking for catering, they'll drive up their cooker to your event and serve from the coals..."
5	pos	train	Everything was great! The crab cakes were the best that I've ever eaten. I recommend Barbara Jeans highly!
5	pos	train	Great food ,great ambiance,Mr.Nino Pernetti owner host great personality and makes you fill at home,will go back again.highly recommended.
5	pos	train	I eat at Riccardo's frequently. The first reason is because the food is great and well priced. The second reason is Sergio, the best waiter I have ever had! Sergio constantly goes out of his way to please his customers and make sure they are having the best dining experience ever! Riccardo's is a great place for a great meal!
5	pos	train	I stopped by after reading a review on a local paper (the montreal mirror) during a weekend business trip...excellent meal at a very reasonable price, the service was personal as the restaurant is run by a family. Will definetaly recommend to anyone visiting this great city
5	pos	train	"In May 2005, Joe Allen celebrates its fortieth anniversary serving Broadway theatergoers and performers. If the man seated across from you seems vaguely familiar, possibly it's because you gave him a standing ovation at the play you just saw. It's not uncommon to see both chorus kids and leading ladies dining here after the show, especially on Saturday night. Located in the heart of Manhattan's theater district, Joe Allen is small and very casual, comfortable and reliable. The restaurant is divided in two, one side featuring a well-stocked bar with a few tables that once comprised the now-defunct smoking section, the other the main dining room. Tables are covered with starched white tablecloths and votive candles, but the formality ends there. Well-worn wooden floors and exposed brick walls, imaginitively covered with framed posters from legendary Broadway flops, give the room a cozy, warm atmosphere. The laid-back ambiance doesn't quite prepare you for the prices, which are definitely on the high side. A few years ago, I brought my pre-teen niece here for lunch, and she naively asked, in a shocked tone of voice, ""Do you realize how many McDonald's hamburgers you can get for the price of one here?"" The difference, of course, is the quality. Your $10.50 burger (add $1.00 for cheese, $2.00 for cheese and bacon) is obviously made with well-spiced Grade A beef and is cooked to order with perfection. We usually tend to forego the starters here to keep down the cost of the meal. Soups range from $7 - 8.00. A small mixed salad is $8.00; cucumber salad with chopped tomatoes, feta cheese, black olives and mint dressing, $11.00. Chicken Salad with trevisano, Gala apples, walnuts, chayote, gruyere, grapes and ginger vinaigrette, offered as a main course for $16.00, is a cornucopia of flavors. The menu changes on a regular basis. Typical entree selections include penne with hot Italian sausage ($18.00), pan-roasted pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and mushroom sauce ($22.00), grilled tuna with white beans, grilled vegetables, and roasted garlic-pepper vinaigrette ($23.00), and grilled sirloin steak with red wine butter and French fries, at $27.00 the most expensive item on the menu. Desserts, ranging from $7.50 to $9.50, are so overpriced we've never ordered any. There's a limit to what I'm willing to spend for watermelon ice with shortbread cookies, and it's a lot less than the $8.50 charged here! You're paying for quality, not quantity, here - portions are of an average size (doggie bags are never necessary), and if you come here pre-theater, you'll be hungry enough to want a snack after the show. The wait staff, mostly comprised of aspiring actors (as in most New York eateries!), generally is friendly and attentive, and will hustle if you let them know you have tickets for a show. I suggest you reserve a table two hours before curtain so you don't feel rushed. The restaurant is open late, making this an ideal destination for a light meal after the show. Reservations are suggested at all times, and are accepted up to one week in advance. MasterCard and Visa are the only credit cards accepted. Obviously, at these prices, the average diner is not going to make a habit of Joe Allen, but it's definitely a once-in-awhile treat. It's always on our must-go-to list when we're in New York. Even if we don't see any stars (and we usually do), it makes for a fun destination before or after a show."
5	pos	train	Our company had a party at Meson Sevilla on saturday night,we all enjoyed the food but enjoyed the tapas even more. This was a good choice I cant think of a tapas place in the area and this was the perfect place for our party. I recomend this place if you like tapas and I strongly recomend you go during the week ,the weekends are just crazy at this place . P.s. Try the sangria it will knock you out.
5	pos	train	I had the best time while at Cedars. The Chicken Tika Masala is to Die for. So are many other dishes. I always have to order a mango lasi (sp?) when i go there. GO!! You will have the best time, and the best food. Cedars it the best indian resturant in the area. i come from over 2 hours away just to eat there!!
5	pos	train	I have actually eaten here several times, it is one of my favorites. The people are always nice and there isn't a long wait for drinks,appetizers, or food. The atmosphere is quiet, even when there are a lot of people there. There has not been one time that I have gone here and not enjoyed it!
5	pos	train	Blue Pacific is consistently great! I have tried every Sushi restaurant in the area and every time is disappointed. Never again will I go anywhere else in the area. Lessons learned. They offer several different specialty rolls and will create anything you wish. The restaurant is softly lit, with a large saltwater fish tank and soft pleasant music adds to the ambiance. Whether you sit at the sushi bar or at a table the service is always excellent. If you love salmon try the double salmon roll, tuna connoisseur try the amazing roll with both red and white tuna on top, for something slightly cooked the TNT roll always pleases. You will not be disappointed with Blue Pacific in Lancaster. A nice treat and getaway from all the buffet restaurants in the area.
5	pos	train	Frank's Pizza is not really a sit-down type of restaurant. It is a traditional pizzeria in a not-so-great part of town. 99% of the time we get the pizza to go, which I highly recommend, as the dining area is usually filled with loud, drunken locals. The important thing is the pizza. Not only is Frank's pizza delicious, the pies are HUGE. The cheese is bountiful, the sauce phenomenal and the pies are so big they LITERALLY do not fit in the box. The only things that could use improvement are the distribution of toppings (more would be nice) and, occasionally, the cheese line is a little off. Still, Frank's Pizza is the best I have ever had in my life. HIGHLY recommended and the owner, Pete (not Frank - that is just the name), is a GREAT guy.
5	pos	train	Eveyone at our table had a great experience. The food was very good. Really nice place.
5	pos	train	We had never been there before but found this gem through pure luck. We frequent many restaurants both in the Boston area and in NYC. If you have not had the chance to eat there yet, make the time. The selection is wonderful and the food is plentiful and flavorful. I have never written a review before but restaurants like this should be supported.
5	pos	train	Best Italian food we ever had! Homemade fresh pasta and the veal dish my guest had was delicious! Very cozy, comfortable,homey atmosphere. The homemade tiramisu(the owner's grandmother's recipe) was out of this world! We will definately be returning!
5	pos	train	I've been a customer for over a decade and now live three hours outside of Chicago. Still, Rokbonki remains my favorite for grill-style dishes and sushi. My favorites: Tokyo shrimp, scallops, horseradish salad, and mai-tais. I've never been disappointed.
5	pos	train	Review deleted due to violation of our posting policy
5	pos	train	The food is excellent, the prices are extremely reasonable and the ambiance is very nice. Not too loud, not too quiet...casual and fun. Chicken paprikash soup rivals some of the best recipes I've ever had. The thai chicken bowl is excellent. And any of their sandwiches always proves to be delicious. Open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Even though the lunch hour during the week is usually crowded, we've never had to wait for a table. And excellent addition to the Warehouse District.
5	pos	train	This is the best pizza in town as they know how to make a good thin crust. I always order the family pleaser which amount to a 16 inch pizza and for a dollar more you get a small pizza also. The cheese is exellent and the sausage is out of this world. I have had plenty of pizza in this town and this is by all means the best in central illinois.plenty of parking and a great dining room which is dimly lit.
5	pos	train	Beautiful ambience, excellent service and marvelous food.
5	pos	train	I had one previous enjoyable experience dining at Greens a few years ago, but this time (on my birthday) it surpassed my expectations. The food, grown at the Zen Center's Green Gulch Farm in Marin County, is extremely fresh, organic, vegetarian and scrumptious. The wine is top-notch. The large room overlooking the bay is pleasant, warm and peaceful, especially at sunset. Every table was full on a Friday night. To give an idea of the menu, I started with mixed greens dressed with a classic vinaigrette, continued with an entree of Mexican pizza with poblano chiles and black beans, which just exploded in my mouth, and for dessert had velvety chocolate bread pudding in a delicious cream sauce. Two glasses of the incredibly good Foxen vineyards Cabernet ($11) had me floating over the table with that feeling of extreme wellbeing that only a fine meal can give you. The only caveat about eating at Greens is that it's pricey. Because the atmosphere was SO pleasant and the food so incredible, I believe it's worth it as an occasional treat.
5	pos	train	Whiskey Creek is located in the tiny town of Keport on the Kitsap Peninsula. The food is awesome, the atmosphere is fun with live piano music every night and old west saloon type decor. The service is excellent and I swear I have never had a better steak. Reservations are recommended for large parties on weekends.
5	pos	train	"We have lived & dined all over the world (England, Holland, Greece, France,....) and all over this country, but if given a choice of where we'd like to be for a meal out it's Riccardo's, hands down. In a state choc full of Italian eateries Riccardo's stands out! When we eat there, nearly every Sunday, we are greeted by the proprietor & chef, Vito Russo, and settle down with our four children for a dinner that will please all. While the kids like to get the usual ""kid"" stuff like pizza & chicken finger, we can enjoy sauteed crab & lobster over pasta in a melt with your mouth, creamy sauce. The lighter fare is delightful and soooo satisfying; try the pepper crusted, pan-seared tuna. A heavenly dinner, a soothing & cozy dining room, and pleasant music, it just doesn't get any better than this!"
5	pos	train	2. Excellent upscale pub food, Irish specializes, the best fish and chips and clam chowder I ever had. Friendly wait staff, efficient kitchen. Very pleasant dining room with views of the city. Downstairs pub, second floor dining room, third & fourth floor nightclub. Genuine Irish musicians weekly.
5	pos	train	This was my first time dining there. They were extremely busy, but our waitress was on tops of things. She was very personable and the atmosphere was a pleasant experience. In fact, I have recommended this restaurant to several people and would go back in a heartbeat.
5	pos	train	"I have been to Riordan's many times when visiting Annapolis. It is one of my most favorite restaurants! The food is great, the atmosphere is wonderful, and it is a totally enjoyable experience!! If you get a chance to visit and the weather is accomodating, eat ""cafe"" style outside. It is nice to have your meal on the table outside and watch the crowds walking by and see the marina area across the street."
5	pos	train	"My friend and I loved it! We found it to be the perfect prelude to a Bobby McFerrin concert. Innovative food --- perfect for both the conservative and adventurous palate. Friendly service... the chef even came out for a quick ""hello."" Very trendy ambience. Reservations a must."
5	pos	train	I've been to Sammy's Seafood three times, twice with my husband, and once with a friend while in New Orleans on business. Obviously, we make it a point to return each time we visit the city. The crawfish etoufee and shrimp creole platter is both plentiful and fabulous. At our last visit, the combo was only $11.95 and included bread - what a great deal! We can't wait to return.
5	pos	train	I JUST CNA'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE AT RICCARDO'S.......BETWEEN THE ATMOSPHERE AND SERVICE BEING SO ATTENTIVE TO THE OWNER PERSONALLY COMING AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EXPERIENCE AT HIS ESTABLISHMENT WAS A POSITIVE ONE. WE TRULY FELT THAT OUR PATRONAGE WAS APPRECIATED AND IT FELT LIKE WE WERE IN SOMEONE'S DINING ROOM INSTEAD OF A RESTAURANT. I WOULD DEFINATELY RECCOMEND THIS ESTABLISHMENT TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS HOMEMADE ITALIAN FOOD AND A GENUINELY WARM ATMOSPHERE.
5	pos	train	Henry's is more of a carry-out restaurant. I always order my food for carry-out, because seating is very limited. My family and I have always been pleased with the food. You can't get no closer to good home cooking. I highly recommend this restuarant.
5	pos	train	Wow! Is all that I can say, we stayed in Vail for a week, ate here 4 times and had a different great experience each time. They make their own beer, have great lunch and dinner fare, live lobster in Vail, CO! And a 150+ selection wine list. Definitely not your average brew pub.
5	pos	train	Truc is a Vietnamese restaurant in the south end of Hartford, They combine the freshest ingredients with light, delicious sauces. The imperial shrimp rolls, beef rolls, mixed seafood and beef sate all rate very high. It is the best Asian restaurant I have eaten at. On top of the food, there is a reasonably priced wine list and the service is attentive and professional. You will return, guaranteed.
5	pos	train	I felt like they actually cared I was there!! Rare these days. Food was excellent and a little adventureous. So good we took home a doggie bag..back to TX on the plane! Made reservations and the table was a little late getting cleared so they comped an appitizer, like I said I felt important. Price is reasonable too.
5	pos	train	It was really unbeliveable..Never saw anything like this. You get in line (yes line place was busy at 7:30pm) place your order with Order taker then follow line grab tray and when your turn ..your order comes out of the kitchen. Taken to seats Place is BEAUTIFUL. Lots of seating. It has strolling mariachis..Cliff diver (YES Cliff Divers) and much more. There is also a game room for the kids. They put on a great show that get the people involed if close enough to. I would highly suggest that place for a different experience. Waiters and Waitresses are wonderfull and very accomading to your needs. If you like Mexican food go there for the experience you wont regret it.
5	pos	train	The Wine Cask is the ultimate pampering experience. Only here could a spilled bottle of wine be handled with such grace that you hardly knew what happened. The service is incredible and is only superceded by the quality and beautiful presentation of the food. The wine list is unmatched. Its worth the price.
5	pos	train	The restaurant is in a century-old Victorian house that is decorated with charm and features music in the background from the '40's - it's a very soothing affect. The food was wonderful! I had the chicken pot pie (served in a flower pot) and my husband had a stuffed green pepper - both of them were delicious! For dessert we had caramel banana pie . . . I've never tasted a dessert so delectable! Our server was very friendly and we never had to ask for a refill once. This restaurant gets my highest marks!
5	pos	train	A wonderful experience. The food and service were very, very good. A warm and charming environment with a pleasant staff. A great find which I will recommend without hesitation. I'm already working on plans to dine here again.
5	pos	train	"Don't miss an opportunity to experience one of the great chefs of the not-too-distant future. Absolutely astoundingly good food...inventive and intriguing, with some exotic approaches, yet totally accessible. Our venison raviolini appetizer with Persian date/mint sauce had me laughing upon taking a bite it was so good. The sauces served up by chefs Adam and Adam are masterful indeed...the mint was hidden in the background of the date sauce. Remarkable! Another winning appetizer is the Asian Beignets, filled with chunks of monkfish and served with a Fresno chile/corn relish and orange sambal cream sauce with a decided kick. They offer a daily ""Soup Exploration"", yet another way to display their mastery in the kitchen. On my first visit, on a cold, wintry night, I expected a hearty chowder when I heard the words ""lobster"" and ""corn"". What I got was an opaque orange broth devoice of anything solid except for a few cilantro leave as garnish. But said broth presented the perfect balance of the essence of both the named ingredients. Stupefyingly good. That same night I was almost overwhelmed by the best venison entree I have ever been served. Perfectly rare medallions, crusted with herbs, surround a bed of truffled risotto with napa cabbage and a few bits of radish for extra texture, offered with a cranberry/sake reduction that proved a perfect foil. Scrumptious! My wife being an incurable foie gras freak had to try the ""Poor Man's Foie Gras"" from their lounge menu. Trout liver, perfectly caramelized, on a bed of frisee with a bit of vinaigrette. I don't even like foie gras, but this was one tasty morsel. And I am not the one to be ordering duck ever, but the preparation offered on our last visit was so intriguing I had to try it. A perfectly cooked duck breast was sliced and presented on a bed of pickled cabbage slaw (warm) strewn with shards of jerk-spiced pork. The crowning touch was a pomegranate reduction (something else I didn't care for until this dish) that added the appropriate contrast to the richness of the duck and the puckery, spicy jerk slaw. Unbelievable! The desserts are every bit as impressive, but the one I remember most is a bread pudding with buttermilk ice cream and a sultana/cherry sauce. It took a couple of bites before I noticed the presence of a touch of cayenne in the sauce, adding a nice snap of heat that was perfectly offset by the pudding and ice cream. The Globe is an uspcale deli for breakfast and lunch, but on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights they convert to The Globe By Moonlight, offering one of the finest culinary experiences to be found anywhere. Best to get there as soon as possible so that when Executive Chef Adam Kreizler is pronounced the next big thing so you can join us in saying ""I ate there when he wasn't famous..."""
5	pos	train	It was great!
5	pos	train	"It was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I have ever had. The food, service, and warm, friendly, atmosphere were all combined to make you feel like one of the ""family"". I can not recommend it highly enough!"
5	pos	train	Beadles is a great place, even if you're not 75. I'm in my 30's and truly have enjoyed my dining expericenes at Beadles. If you want good food at good prices, and a little slice of nostalgic Americana, Beadles is the place to go!
5	pos	train	I love this place. It has the tastiest steaks in town. The biggest, freshest, and most varied salad bar I have seen. Our waitress was attentive and courteous without being intrusive. The atmosphere is right up my alley with people coming in off the street after work in jeans & cowboy hats. It's everything a Montana restaurant should be.
5	pos	train	I think they are excellent. they have the best wine and meat.
5	pos	train	The food is great! The view is wonderful. The only bad thing is the wait for a table. We go every time we are in Charleston.
5	pos	train	It is a tiny place, although they're expanding, with about 12 tables. Excellent, attentive service, reasonable wine list, and the food! The food is out of this world. We had the swordfish with some kind of sauteed spinach, corn, smoked bacon side. Amazing! Also, the desserts! Really good warm chocolate-pear tart. It was about $130 for two including wine and dessert.
5	pos	train	Our food was great. I loved the large choice on the menu. There is something for everyone. I also like the fact that the owners are always on hand with a friendly greating. Next time I am going to try not to eat so much of my dinner so I can try one of their many choices of deserts. Oh ya, don't forget to check out the Bar manager. He is a hottie. OOPs that wasn't one of the questions, was it!!!!
5	pos	train	One of the best burgers I have ever had! And the onion rings were great also!
5	pos	train	This has to be one of the best breakfast buffets around. Just 45 minutes from Philadelphia, and well worth the trip. If you like French toast, you will enjoy the Baked French Toast made here. All they need is a vanilla sauce and you have bread pudding. I go here just for this. They also have home-made yogurt, and the usual buffet items...eggs made to order omlettes an assortment of meats, potatoes and fruit. Pancakes come in many flavors. Try the cinnamon, sweet potato or mix and match...raisins,nuts, berries, apples, you name it and they probably can make it.
5	pos	train	The ultimate expensive-but-worth-it, special-occasion place to go, this Continental stalwart is Boulder's mountainside treat. Set in a cabin circa 1929, Flagstaff House has floor-to-ceiling windows with a spectacular view. The French cuisine with asian accents is world-class and the service was exquisite. I was very impressed by the Wine Spectator award-winning restaurant. It was absolute perfection!
5	pos	train	It was very nice experience
5	pos	train	One of the main reasons my wife and I visit Lexington, KY. The food is exceptional and the experience is truly enjoyable. The only negative we have ever had was the tropical drinks were a bit weak last time. This is a must stop when staying in Lexington.
5	pos	train	My girlfriend and i had dinner at riccardo's and chef vito prepared us a beautiful meal i had boneless rib eye steak fajita's and they were fantastic. the fajitas began with beautiful seared strips of boneless rib eye with a medly of assorted sauteed vegatables that consisted of fresh pea pods, juilianne cut carrots, assorted colered peppers and carmelized onions...served on a beautifully garnished sizzeling hot plate. for dessert we had an incredible beautifully decorated plate of homemade new york cannolis. my hats off to chef vito. thank you for my experience!!!!! Chef, Kraig Widzins
5	pos	train	We went there with friends while in town and had a really awesome experience. Wwe even go to tour the kitchen!! I met the chef, JOel Antunes, (who is cute!) and saw their 62 foot french stove (no open flames). They even have a satellite controlled freezer system and a refrigerated marble pastry counter. You can even attend a cooking class on the first Saturday of the month for $125. and invcludes your lunch that you cook. This place was amazing. I had the Pennsylvania snails in broth and scallops confit leek with truffle and banyul sauce with tortellini. OH and creme brulee although the creme brulee (always my fave) paled in comparison to the scallops I had before it. The waiter was really great, but the female waitress for the table behind me bumped into my chair hard! FOUR times and really was starting to irritate me. She either needs lipo of the hips or she needs to watch where she is going. It actually affected my experience so much that I seriously alnost grabbed her and told her to watch it. Joel Antunes was an incredible chef and would love to have dinner there again.
5	pos	train	Chef Dan offers Friday night seafood specials that will rival any 5 star Urban restaurant. Duck is also on the menu and will find none better prepared--the steaks are great as well. Full salad bar, lively bar with friendly people--if you find yourself in this little resort town, you must visit Quit Qui Oc for dinner.
5	pos	train	It is always very pleasurable to dine here. The food is excellent, the service is very good and they are knowledgable of the menu and how it is prepared. I'd recommend it to anyone.
5	pos	train	A very relaxed place to dine, like sitting at home with friends. Great Service, Friendly, your never a stranger twice. Foods all ways hot, people are all ways friendly. We live 50 miles away now but all ways stop there when we make a trip back to the old neighborhood.
5	pos	train	This is one place you MUST experience if you come to Peoria. A legend downtown. A great bar with just outstanding food. The place is a little small but the lunch time crowd is manageable. You won't be disappointed.
5	pos	train	This is an upscale restaurant with a lovely ambiance. The staff is professional and most helpful. the Tapas style dining is very conducive to sharing and tasting an array of dishes. We loved it!
5	pos	train	Da Vinci is a wonderful place. I was on vacation in Los Angeles from New York and my friend told me about this gem. What attracted me was the had told me it was where Dean Martin & The Rat Pakc would dine and that it held it's charm while still having great food! The place and service were wonderful! What a great place to take a date! They played nothing but rat packish music mixed in with Harry Connick and Michael Buble, made the ambience. The decor is wonderful, straight out of the rat pack era with a wonderful arrangement of flowers. The waiters were friendly and sexy and the cocktails were fun! I ordered a martini, a side car, and a wonderful concoction they call the Davinci Cocktail! LOVED IT! The food was so delcious! I recommend this place for anyone who just wants to pamper themselves or impress a friend!
5	pos	train	Excellent dining experience. Very pleasant and attentive staff. Great Atmosphere.
5	pos	train	Great pasta dishes, an extensive wine list, and a broad attentive staff..the hostess came over, complimented my suit and asked if my meal was prepared correctly; Hello, am I still in New York? Extraordinary!
5	pos	train	"The Marlin Grill is a fabulous seafood restaurant located in BayTowne Wharf-SanDestin Resort. There is inside as well as patio dining. The patio is quite nice, as you are able to ""people watch"" and listen to live music from the nearby establishments. The food is outstanding. Some of the freshest fish you will ever taste. A nice treat is the ""strolling bread basket""- offering unique breads,rolls and butters."
5	pos	train	Please disregard the first review of Thai Inter Restaurant. This review was written by a former employee who was dismissed as a result of her mental instability and spiteful nature. Our only regret is that this revolting individual ever worked for us. We assure you that this horrid person is by no means a reflection of our establishment. Please come and dine with us and enjoy authentic Thai cuisine at reasonable prices in a delightful atmosphere.
5	pos	train	I was hungry for an enchilada plate. Being from Texas, the combo plate of two enchiladas, rice, beans, and fried tortilla chips with salasa is what we most commonly refer to as the enchilada plate. Vila's bills itself as a Mexican-Cuban restaurant of which there are many in South Florida, but most are Cuban restaurants with an afterthought to Mexican food. That is not surprising, given the number of Cuban Americans in South Florida. Imagine my happy surprise to find that Vila's balanced their menu 50/50. The appetizers include a Mexican Sampler ($12.95) and a Cuban Sampler ($14.95). The mexican sampler features a chicken and a beef taco, a bean enchilada, a chicken quesadilla, chicken and beef nachos, guacamole, and sour cream. The Cubans Sampler ahs 2 meat pies, 2 ham croquettes, pok with tamale, chicken chunks and plantain chips. There are other assorted appetizers from $2.95 to 5.99. The Mexican entrees include Steaks, Chicken, Burros, Flautas, and fish not to mention fajitas. The Cuban offerings include favorites like Palomilla Steak, Garlic Chicken Chunks, Vaca Frita, Lechon, and Ropa Vieja just no name a few. The $12.95 Combinacion Vila's Includes Lechon Asado, Chicken Chunks, a Beef Enchilada, and yellow rice and refried beans all served with a basket of Tortilla Chips and salsa. I had the Enchiladas Rancheras which were two beef (although you may have chicken or cheese if you wish) enchiladas, Mexican rice and refried beans. The enchilada were tasty but perhpas a bit heavy on the chili powder, the beans were excellent, and the rice was good, though a bit dry for my taste, but still very good. The service was excellent even though my server had a party of about 15 at a large table which she and another person were serving, at no time did I feel that I needed anything. Vila's has three locations. Vila's #1 at 2027 South State Road 7 in Ft. Lauderdale 954-792-4713. Vila's #2. (Where I ate) 4000 N. University Drive, Sunrise 954-746-7474. And Vila's #3, 1417 E. Commercial Blvd., Ft. Lauderdale 954-771-6340.
5	pos	train	"I agree w/Chris - we visit Estes Park several times a year and always make a point of visiting this restaurant. The food is wonderful, the service is great, and since the restaurant serves vacationers from all over the world, I highly doubt they're ""prejudiced"" against people of color. We've never been the only ""white people"" on our visits; and we've never observed anyone receiving anything but courteous and exceptional service."
5	pos	train	The Norhtwestern Steak House is one of the midwests best kept secrets. We were in Mason City for a marathon, yes Mason City in addition one of the best steak houses, offers one of the best kept secrets in a Midwest Marathon and Half Marthon. And, before and after running 26.2 miles, there food and beveages are fantastic. We all recommend it and can only reinforce what the other visitors have said about it. Oh yes, an plan on waithing to get in if you want to be seated at 5 PM. But as others have said, there is a quaint little lounge upstairs you can get to through the kitchen. The NW Steakhouse is worth the effort to find and go to; they also offer Walleye, lamb chops and chicken rotissarie chicken breast, Greek seasones....awesome. I had the prime rib, try it, you will not be disappointed. Also, if you run, try the marathon or half marathon in October!
5	pos	train	"This is a great culinary addition to Mooresville! It is a ""modern Mexican"" restaurant that is located in a restored church. Traditional ""platters"" are available for traditional diners, however, the best items on the menu are the custom styled seafood entrees. The pan seared grouper with mango glaze is the best ever! Don't forget to try the Poblano Soup."
5	pos	train	Excellent food. Anyone who would tell you different just fell off a turnip truck in town.
5	pos	train	What an incredible, beautiful dinning expereince. The food was fabulous; extra large portions, beautifully presented; fresh ingredients, and first rate fish. chicken and beef. The wait staff is superb! Lovely atmosphere, too!
5	pos	train	The owner's of Jay's (Jay and Jackie) have put their heart and soul into this place! They remember their regular customers by name and treat everyone special. The dining rooms are beautifully decorated, the wine list extensive and the menu creative. Life music also adds to a fantastic dining experience. A real gem in Fort Collins!
5	pos	train	The Alamo Steakburger is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten!
5	pos	train	When we first arrived we where sceptical because the place was so bussy. but from the time we were seated, which was about 15 minutes after our reservation time, to our desswrt we where treated great and the waiter was personable, and the food was to die for. We where very happy and we would return.
5	pos	train	Fantastic! We were treated like favorite customers even though we do not splurge at a restaurant like this very often.
5	pos	train	We've gone to the Progress Grill for the last several years when we're in Harrisburg. It's refined and just exquisite...like entering an exclusive club. The food is wonderful -- terrific seafood, served well with attentive waitstaff. They take very good care of you. I highly recommend you make reservations.
5	pos	train	The food was very good and the service was more then friendly. My ice tea was replace within the momeny I finished the last swallow. We were treated as if we were very impotant people. It is one of the best kept secret in New Jersey and if I have any thing to say about it. that is about to change. And Vito Russo is an execeative chief without question.
5	pos	train	My friends and I always make it a special occasion to celebrate each others' birthdays at Lincoln Cafe. The food is absolutely the best quality! We felt this was a pleasant escape from the normal steak and potato restaurant which is so prevelant in the Midwest. We cherish every bite and our palate is never bored! We do make it a point to get different dishes so we can share between each other....and NEVER FORGET DESSERT!!!!! The selections are great for beef, pork or chicken lovers. If you do feel you have to have a burger, theirs is top notch. I highly recommend it to everyone in the vicinity! Worth the trip! Going there again this weekend and can't wait! (Some mean person told my friend it was closed and she was near tears. Luckily I'm in that town often and knew better...it's alive and well.)
5	pos	train	This little bistro is tucked away, just off of the town green in a an old victorian house. The food is Sicilian fare of chicken, fish, beef and veal dishes. There is always a nice variety of desserts to end your meal. Casual atmosphere - Fine dining food. Nunu's doesn't serve wine - so bring your own. I always bring champagne, because it goes with everything. Reservations are required Friday and Saturday evening.
5	pos	train	They have the BEST Mexican food in Dallas.... We eat there at least once a week. Try the Taco's Al Cabon (sp).
5	pos	train	This was an amazing place to eat. My husband and I love to go to good restaurants and this one is now one of our favorites. The food and atmosphere were wonderful! We also ate at The Old Post, Alexanders and (although they were good) they paled in comparison to Red Fish.
5	pos	train	"This place is a real find. It's been open for only a few weeks and nobody knows about it yet, but it seems the stars know about this little secret known as Fat Fish. I've been there three times already, and twice I saw celebrities hanging out in the lounge. But more than anything it's the awsome food that just keeps me coming back. Their appetizers are just awsome and the rolls are not only yummy, but they are creative and not what you would expect, but in a good way. Their bar menu is also extensive and they have some awsome bartenders making some of the best (and biggest) martinis in town. I would go there now, before they get too crowded. Hopefully they don't get big headed, because the service was very friendly and top notch in a casual way. I'd definitely recommend this little secret. And who names a restaurant ""FAT FISH""?! But it's cool."
5	pos	train	My parents live in Sheboygan and we visit from Wyoming at least once a year. We stay at a near by motel and eat at Nino's at least once each time we visit. You can always count on friendly service and good food. Plus, they make a terrific brandy old fashion sweet! (That you can only seem to find in the Sheboygan area.) I suggest you try their trout with a baked sweet potato. EXCELLENT!!
5	pos	train	It does not get any better than this!!! EXCELLENT FOOD! EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!
5	pos	train	An excellent restaurant. The food was wonderful, the service friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere warm and homey. It was the best Valentine's dinner I ever had!
5	pos	train	The best little seafood place in Lanham, MD. I would/do recommend to everyone I know!!!
5	pos	train	My experience over the years has been great. The food is great, the prices are decent seeing as the Canadian beef marker is crazy right now, the service the most experienced you will find in St. Joseph. Many people that are found working there have worker there for atleast 10 years, and know how to treat everyone just right. The atmosphere makes the experience fun to be in resulting from the old western feel. Nothing in St. Joseph can match this today.
5	pos	train	Frankie's is a GREAT Italian Bistro! Specialities include: pasta dishes, wood fired pizzas, and classic veal entrees. The marinara sauce and handmade meatballs are fabulous! You can taste fresh herbs and garlic throughout. Portions are generous and most entrees can easily be split. BONUS-- great wine list with 58 bottles $30 or less. They now take reservations--which are STRONGLY suggested Thurs-Sun evenings. Mangia!
5	pos	train	The food offered at the Blue Waters Mountain Lodge is traditional southern cuisine. Prepared with a new age flair, and complete with homemade breads and desserts, entrees at the Lodge are complimented by fresh local fruits and vegetables, and herbs from the Lodge's gardens.
5	pos	train	They got it right. From the moment I walked in the door I was greated with a smile. It is a small family owned resturant and the owners are always around. They don't hide in the office , they personally go to tales to ensure everything is okay with your meal. Best service I ever had received was there by a waitress whoose name is Jean C. She was great.
5	pos	train	We arrived in Ravello during a journey on the coast of Amalfi. The restaurant - a part of the Hotel -was suggested from a taxi driver as it's one of the most popular of the area. The view is stunning, we had a large table on the veranda and we ate Scalatilli with mushrooms and seafoods and Crespello (a crepe filled with local cheeses) and a fish with a special tomato sauce (I think the name of the dish was in guazeto). There's a large selection of wines at a very affordable price. The staff was very friendly and helpull in suggesting what to eat. Reasonable price, a good value for money place where we wish to return in the future.
5	pos	train	We usually eat at this restaurant once every few months. If you arrive earlier than your reservation, you can relax in the bar-they have appetizers laid out! The service is wonderful! The lighting is perfect, the food is wonderful, & the service is awesome! Reservations are recommended, but they will try their best to get you in ASAP. If you are ever in the area for a visit-you must try Nino's!
5	pos	train	Wonderful Very Informal Restaurant, this chinese resturant offers the best in Informal Hong Kong Cusine in the Wash. DC area. Must haves are HK Style Shrimp Dumpling Noodle, Congee, and Beef Chow Foon. Other favs are Clams w/ Black Bean Sauce and Soy Sauce Chicken. Like any other busy Hole in the Wall resturant, you better know what you want or else you're going to the back of the line! Yes, it's a sit down place and Cash Only.
5	pos	train	What a lovely restaurant! The service is very friendly and the food is the best I've tasted in Puget Sound! They make the best Phad Kee Mau I've ever had - and that's saying a lot. The chef is versatile and will make substitutions easily as requested. This is truly a hidden gem.
5	pos	train	We have been visiting the Lewes and Rehobeth area for the past 30 years and dined at most of the restaurants in Lewes and Rehobeth. La Rosa Negra is our favorite place to dine. The atmosphere is great, the meal is always delicious, the prices are reasonable, the wine list is extensive and impressive, the desserts are heavenly, and the wait staff is knowledgeable and courteous. Living in the Washington DC metropolitan area we often dine at several 5 star restaurants, yet, La Rosa Negra is our favorite  we wish it was located in DC. We have referred numerous friends and they too have raved about the food, ambiance, and reasonable prices, have become repeat customers and referred their family and friends. For those of you visiting Lewes, DE we highly recommend La Rosa Negra. You be the judge and don't be fooled by negative press.
5	pos	train	Well, I'm 23 years old and I LOVE this place. Have been going for many years and before that I was a patron of the Pasadena Cafeteria (defunct). The food is always very good and absolutely unbeatable for value. Atmosphere is exactly what dining should be and the only thing I can criticize is the sometimes slow table service. If I were a rich man, I would live on Orange Grove Avenue and eat at Beadle's everyday!
5	pos	train	This is a fairly new restaurant and they are fast becoming a local favorite. We arrived and we pleased to be greated by a warm friendly face in a very quaint atmoshere. Filled with all sorts of nautical decour. That was just the beginning! The food was absolutely great! You must try the homemade crabcakes as they are wonderful, filled with crabmeat yes lots of crabmeat..Then there was the stuffed flounder! wow made fresh you can tell and broiled with a garlic butter to set it off! Well I recommend you donot miss this one! Well worth the drive and the price is just right! Frank and Susan
5	pos	train	Melrose Grill is a fantastic place to eat! The atmosphere and service are exceptional, and the food is even better. I have recommended Melrose Grill to several friends who have all enjoyed their experience as much as I regularly do. You'd be crazy to not go and try their steaks, as they are affordable and the best in Seattle.
5	pos	train	Off North College in Indianapolis through a set of mature trees sits an old classic, Hollyhock Hill. Seating 10, we had a full staff servicing our table. Highly reccommend their fried chicken, a dish they are known for. The dinner is served family style. Before you know it, you are over at grandmas having a feast-passing mashed potatoes, corn, green beans, and chicken around for all to dig in to. This is a great place to take the family for a birthday. The food is homecooked country style, the owners stand in the middle of the restaurant to make sure all goes off without a hitch. This is definately a must visit.
5	pos	train	We had a wonderful time. Good service, great food, pleasant atmosfere, and an oustanding vodka infusion. A 10 in my opinion.
5	pos	train	Sazio is a great new Italian restaurant located in the Orleans. it has great portions and a cool hip atmosphere.
5	pos	train	The food was amazing. I've never tasted such fine Peruvian food.
5	pos	train	This is a first-class restaurant, and worth a drive from anywhere in the Daytona Beach area! I have just returned from a 5-day conference, and most of my fellow conferees chose Stonewood as the very best place we found all week, for both food and dedication of the staff to providing an excellent dining experience. Several of my group are world travelers and accustomed to the finest restaurants, and all were impressed with Stonewood. The place is very popular, and although they tell you they will NOT take reservations, they will (quietly) if the group is for 7 or more. It is well worth the wait. The steaks are prime, the seafood luscious, and the vegetables fresh, and the soups and sides are excellent. My group rated the creamed spinach as the best we have ever eaten (and are still raving about it days later). The wait staff was smart, informative, fun, and served us quickly and professionally. At the end of the meal, the manager queried one diner about her experience, and she responded that although most of it was excellent, she had one minor complaint; the manager then pointed to his name on a restaurant sign, saying that his reputation depended on her complete satisfaction, handed her a coupon for a return visit, and begged her to come back to let the staff try to do better. I sincerely rate Stonewood with all superlatives, and long to return to Daytona to enjoy it again!
5	pos	train	It was absolutely wonderful. the staff were all courteous. The food was out of this world delicious! I am now a regular, even though I live an hour away. But it is definately worth the drive. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place to everyone. You will not be disappointed by the food. It only seems to get better and better each time!
5	pos	train	The cook and his staff are warn and very accomodating. The food was even better. I haven't tasted a meatball sandwich like that since my italian Gramma was alive. Much Good Luck to this hard working, pleasing crew.
5	pos	train	Best I've ever had in the state of Ca. I always go there when in the area I live in atwater ca 21/2 hr drive love their food. Really great place to eat!
5	pos	train	I LOVE this place!! I just moved to LV and this place is on my regular dining places listl I love their escargot, their bread and tapanade-like tomato spread is FANTASTIDC And their pastas are superb. Plus you can get ravioli for like 6 bucks after 12 am. Also, the live entertainment is very cool ala old Vegas. Almost Tony Bennet-like.
5	pos	train	We normally order the Gero Sub with fries, and coke or Iced Tea. This will come out to about $17.00 for two. Have had their pizza, and it's delicious!
5	pos	train	It was the Best! This is one fine restaurant and the chef is A-One. THis restaurant is the best kept secret in the Pinelands, serving gormet meals that are true Italian! In fact I've been to Italy and eaten in the best restaurants and I truly believe Chef Vito equals the finest!
5	pos	train	Such a pleasant surprise. Never expected to find such a wonderful Italian gem like this so close to home. The portions are huge. I've got all my neighbors going too!
5	pos	train	My husband and I spent a great deal of time trying to choose a very special place to celebrate an important family occasion, and we couldn't have been happier with Brioche at the Berkeley. From first to last, our experience of the restaurant was stupendous. The food was fantastic: a wonderful array of options ranging from beautifully prepared versions of familiar favorites to innovative culinary treats. Everything was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. The music was lovely. The service was stupendous as well. Our waitress was friendly, attentive and eager to accommodate our every request. The care and attention to detail made this truly one of our most precious family gatherings ever.
5	pos	train	This place is one of the finest restaurants in Key West. The food is exceptional, the wine list impressive and the staff are experts in both food and wine with an upscale atmosphere. These people are professionals in food service and enjoy what they are doing which makes your dining experience that much better. We've been here many times and each visit seems better than the last. Make reservations! This is a must! Very pricey though! Fine French dinning with great specials & the yellowtail is out of this world! Worth the $$$$'s.
5	pos	train	Fans of great northern Indian food in Reno were heartbroken when the S.S. Super Indian Restaurant closed late last year, but--joy of joys--they merely moved to a nicer location, and are now Taste of India. The food, especially their tandoori chicken, the nan bread hot from the oven, and the palek paneer (spinach curry with homemade cheese) is to die for. And the service makes one feel like an emperor or empress! The lunch buffet 11:30-2:30) is a favorite with the many repeat customers (like ourselves)and the dinners (4-10 p.m.) are elegant and beautifully served. Wine and beer are available, although we are hooked on the (non-alcoholic) strawberry lassi. So the interior decoration wasn't done by a slick professional. It is clean, colorful, and adds to the exotic atomsphere. Highly recommended!
5	pos	train	Truly decadent. What impressed me most was the fact that Mario Batali was there at his own restaurant. His staff says he's devoted and a great boss to work for. I'm impressed. The Italian cuisine is creative and makes your heart skip a beat. I suggest being adventurous and stray away from the tasting menu. Make up your own with the help of their fantastic wait staff.
5	pos	train	"The Little pink cards scattered throughout the cafe welcomes you and give you ordering instructions, part of the process involves raising your hand when your name is called. They also recommend tripping the server to get their attention; I personally don't think that is a good idea, simply because you would probably miss some of the world's best clam chowder as you are being escorted from the building. They Claim to sell more clam chowder than any other restaurant on the west coast, last year alone the Splash Cafe Owners Joanne and Ross Currie prepared over 10,000 gallons of the creamy sauce. When I passed through the city of Pismo Beach, which is located just about midway between Los Angeles and San Francisco, I noticed a line of customers wrapping around the block, and while I personally hate lines, I had to see what the all the fuss was. To my suprise and enjoyment It turned out to be the best stop I ever made! So good I took a fresh frozen pint home with me! I am going to say the Splash Cafe makes the ""BEST CLAM CHOWDER"" I have ever had and I have had plenty. I am a Clam Chowder addict and I just found my new fix! The Splash Cafe has a great presentation when you order the sourdough bread bowl. I don't want to give away their secret, I suggest you swing by Pismo Beach (a great tourist spot) and check out the Splash Cafe! Hey Joanne and Ross could you send me some more of your chowder!!!! I heard you are opening one in San Luis Obispo, I want an invite to the grand opening! CEO Of We8there.com"
5	pos	train	I've been going to Delargy's Bistro for over a year. I've made at least six visits for either lunch or dinner. The food is delectable and plentiful. The prices are mostly in the high teens for dinner and mostly below $12.00 for lunch. I like the fact that Chef Chuck Delargy uses real olive oil on his Greek Salad! (Mmm) The restaurant is upscale casual and is no smoking, except for the small bar at the back. The wait staff are well trained and are very friendly and helpful, but not intrusive. This place is just about the best place to eat in Greater Hampton Roads. Try it!
5	pos	train	It's hard to describe this atmosphere...the only thing I can say is that the food here is like works of art...the feeling of the place is almost as excuisite as the food..I will be having my 21st birthday party here next month without a doubt
5	pos	train	Victory Lane turned out to be a Great Neighborhood Bar and Restaurant under one roof. Nice smoke free dining area or a big roomy bar with lots of tables around it and lots of TV's. Good music playing and just a real friendly atmosphere. Quick servers that check on you all the time to make sure you're happy. Great menu with tons of appetizers, sandwiches, soups and salads. Plus a nice slection of entres including everything from Mussles to Prime Rib, Fajitas to Great Pasta Dishes. You get a lot for your money here. My daughter had Penne Pasta in Pink Vodka Sause with grilled Shrimp. My wife had The Mussles in garlic Sauce, and Jeremy had Mussles and Clams Fra Diablo. I had one of their Specialties. WINGS! A platter they make up with a sampling of their 3 styles. Bar-B-Q, Garlic, and of course, Buffalo! Got a Dinner Salad with that and I was set! We will go back there regularly now!!! The prices are very reasonable and the food is excellent!
5	pos	train	Pizzaria Uno always has excelent Deep Dish Pizza. The mid-day lunch specials are an extrordanary deal, and well worth it. I highly recomend this location.
5	pos	train	The nicest people, best service, excellent food....
5	pos	train	Osaka has the nicest wait staff and the sushi there is to die for. The service is wonderful. It is a smaller sushi restaraunt that also serves japanese food other than sushi. The decor is very nice and the atmosphere is very comfortable. I have been to a lot of sushi restaraunts and this by far is my favorite. .
5	pos	train	This has to be the best cracker barrel in the USA. Just plain country cooking. My wife and I stopped here on our way to Nashville airport for supper. The food was great, the service was great, and the staff made you feel right at home. We definitely stop here again whenever we go back east.
5	pos	train	The B&O Restaurant and Brewery in Youngstown, Ohio is a Jewel in our community. It is located in the old B&O train station near the river. The owners of this establishment have completed a major restoration of the building and grounds. This shows not only in the facilities but also in the way that the employees take pride in their jobs. The 1st thing one will notice walking in, is the shear size of this building. There is a lower level with many tables, booths, and of course a bar. Beyond the bar lies the brewing kettles and a fermenting tank. These are just a few of the tanks and kettles required to make an excellent selection of micro brews. The upstairs balcony level is reached by a twisting grand staircase. Once you have a seat it is time to try some of their fair and/or drink. The food is all very high quality and fresh. I must recommend the chicken quesadilla that is served with homemade salsa and sliced jalapenos. The beers are of the finest microbrews in Ohio. They produce a varying selection of lagers, pilsners, ales, stouts, and porters. I have had a chance to try these and must say that each has its own distinct flavor and aroma. If you like a lighter pilsner style beer you should try their Derailment. It is has a very low bitterness and is brewed with orange peel and Juniper berries. It tends to be very enjoyable and cleansing to the palate. If you desire a heavier more road bust beer try the Gandy dancer. This is an imperial stout brewed with coffee. You can detect the coffee flavor, but it in no way overpowers the taste of the beer. For those of you that want a very different flavor try the Porter. This is brewed with, and provides the flavor of chocolate. The B&O is a place to have a beer or a very good dinner. If you find yourself in Youngstown and wish to relax this is the place. Everyone needs to support local businesses and this is no exception. This I would say is a reason to support local business. The B&O celebrates its 100th birthday next year. It is the longest continuous running train station in Ohio. Let's make sure it is still open for its 100th.
5	pos	train	It was good
5	pos	train	On a quiet sidestreet, you'll find Gasparito, located in a traditional Cunucu house. Serving traditional Aruban fare, the food was perfect in both presentation and taste. Each meal is served with a side of Aruban vegetables. Although Gasparito was packed, the service was not too slow or too fast - no one rushes in Aruba.
5	pos	train	I loved the look and feel of this place. It was eating somewhere in Europe. The food was great, and the people knew what they were talking about in regards to the food. There was also a HUGE selection of Cheese, with little blurbs about each one and what it might go with. The food was great and priced well. I would go there every day for lunch if I was closer.
5	pos	train	It was for our 5th Wedding Anniversary. The crab cake appetzer is to DIE for. They cooperated with my husband on some special requests for the table and really spoiled us, knowing the occasion. We accutally lived in the apartment complex to the front of the restaurant across the highway. We live in Houston now, but will make the trip to have this experience again !
5	pos	train	We had a fantastic time. The food and service are exceptional and the Martini list is huge. They have 10 beers on draft and an exceptional wine list. The food at this restaurant is the best on the whole west side of Michigan. You have to give this restaurant a try, you'll love it.
5	pos	train	I've been there several times, and always found a great deal on great food. There was a slight mix-up with losing our order, so we waited a while before it came out. As soon as the problem was discovered, however, the manager came to our table and assured us that they would cover the meal. (yeah -- 100%) We didn't have to complain or make a big deal about it; they just fixed it right away. I've been in a DIFFERENT restaurant where I had to press the manager to take action when I found a bug in my salad, so I appreciate a place that knows the value of repeat business. You know the saying, if you handle a customer's problem well, she's more loyal than if there was never a problem in the first place.
5	pos	train	"Went there for a business lunch. They qualify this restaurant as ""Asian fusion"", mixing tradition and modernity in a beautiful arrangement. The food (seafood and poultry) was really good, and the service friendly, slick and professional. Very interesting and pleasant lunch. Definitely another good place to eat in the Bay Area!!! Be careful, although it's said to be on El Camino Real itself, in fact the entrance is in a little nearby street and the parking lot in the back."
5	pos	train	Over all it was one of the best dinners that we have ever had out.
5	pos	train	We found this restaurant by accident. It is located just off Route 46 and Passaic Avenue on Little Falls Road. When we called for reservations, we were told to bring our own wine as Aria was BYOB. The sounds of live piano, the ambiance of a beautiful Tuscan villa - it was elegant. We were immediately served wonderful warm bread and complementary bruschetta. The menu had many appetizers, and about 20 entrees, and the waiter gave us quite a list of specials. For Appetizers, we enjoyed Warm Eggplant and Mozzarella Timbale in a Tomato Fondue, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella with Tomato and Roasted Pepper, Fresh Mozzarella between Crispy Pan-Fried Bread, and Mixed Seafood Salad. All were excellent, and the Seafood Salad was quite large. I had an arugula salad with Gorgonzola cheese, pears, and walnuts with balsamic vinagrette that was delicious. All the entrees were delicious from the simple Penne Arrabbiata, to the Chicken Marsala - Chicken scaloppini in a wild mushroom and Marsala wine sauce, to Chicken Paillard - paper thin chicken breast grilled and drizzled with fresh herb olive oil, to my favorite - Baked Salmon - blackened and bathed in almond and horseradish sauce served on a bed of fennel. Wonderful coffee, cappucino, and espresso, and dessert including cheesecake with strawberries and sauce; tartufo, and an exceptional tri-colored mousse finished our delightful dining experience.
5	pos	train	The best Pizza I have found in South Florida! Michael, the owner is awesome, the staff is very kind & the place is beautiful. Wait till you see that Giant coal oven!
5	pos	train	We had an extraordinary time! Celebrating a friend's birthday - everything was beyond perfect. Our birthday guest's name was written on the sidewalk in chalk, champagne awaited us at the table, the food and service were beyond compare and the birthday girl's name was written on her dessert plate in chocolate! Divine!
5	pos	train	Iozzo's probably has some of the best Italian food in Wausau. Their gnoche is the best I have had. The staff is friendly and courteous and ready to help you with their suggestions and knowledge of the menu.
5	pos	train	Best place for my money, Everybody friendly, food great. Been there many times. Don`t Change....
5	pos	train	A fun and friendly atmosphere. a great value and great food.
5	pos	train	They offer an elegant yet comfortable and casual atmosphere, but also offer what is the most authentic, freshly prepared Italian cuisine in the area. This is a small chain in the midwest. Really the atmosphere is great. The prices are reasonable and the portions are good, but not outrageous. I like it because they make you feel like family. Good variety on the wine list. Smoking is allowed, although if you are in a non-smoking section the smoking is not noticeable. This is another nice difference from other restaurants. I highly recommend this place. Oh yeah, you can make a reservation, not found with the big chain restraints.
5	pos	train	This is really a neat place. The atmosphere was great. Waitress was really on the ball. We had a Beef Plate and one had a Sandwich. Home Baked bread.. Large menu with almost anything you could want. Sandwiches, sea food and steaks. You would not leave hungry. Food was excellent and portions were huge.
5	pos	train	Roscoe's has been my favorite restaurant for more than 10 years, located directly across from the CBS local television station in Hollywood, Roscoe's continues to serve up a tasty serving of chicken and waffles. Roscoe's is the place where it is not uncommon to see a celebrity pop in for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I really love the scrambled cheese eggs served anytime of the day and gauge every other restaurant by Roscoe's standards, however if you going to visit Roscoe's you must try their name sake! The chicken and waffles are a perfect meal after you've spent a few hours sightseeing around Hollywood or just want something different and unique. Ask for Toni she is one of the best servers and will take very good care of you. Roscoe's is always busy so please be prepared to wait a little before getting seated. There are 5 Roscoe's restaurants around the Los Angeles area but I usually skip them all for the atmosphere of the Hollywood restaurant.
5	pos	train	The Java House Has to be one of my all time favorites when it comes to breakfast, the staff is always warm and friendly you can dine inside or al Fresco adjacent to the Marina. Java House is conveniently located in the shadows of Pacific Bell Park the home of the San Francisco Giants. During game days you can get a hot dog and beer for around seven dollars, try that at any ball park in America, you will spend close to seven dollars just for the beer! From everything from burger's to their world famous Java, you must make the Java house one of your stops while visiting San Francisco
5	pos	train	You will find the atmosphere very cozy and inviting. The food is prepared to perfection everytime (nothing over cooked). The menu is small but there is something for everyones taste (seafood, duck etc...). When ever I know I will be in Ticonderoga, I make a reservation because it is usually crowded and the restuarant proper is on the small side.
5	pos	train	"Box Seats is a great place for the familty to go out to dinner. They feature a help yourself soup / bread bar, and a ""Wall of Fire"" with dozens of different types of hot sauce to complement your meal. Their menu selection contains a wide variety of foods, from your standard sandwiches to more exotically flavored meals. Their french fries are simply tremendous!"
5	pos	train	I have been traveling every week for six years. I have had dinner in San Fancisco to the Bahamas. I have been in Memphis for the last 6 months and this was the BEST meal I have had since I have been here. I would rank it to one of the top 10 of all time! I am not sure what the other reviews orderd but the hand cur 14oz Ribeye with the Gouda souce was excelent! I will deffinatly return.
5	pos	train	The Wednesday night Spaghetti Dinner is my favorite!! Along with the cannoli's!
5	pos	train	The food is incredible. A perfect little gem in the middle of Struthers Ohio. We had the Braciole, Seafood in Vodka sauce with Asiago, steaks with the chef's seasoning, garlic mashed potatoes, Italian greens, the Seafood appetizer platter - all were to die for!
5	pos	train	Outstanding food and the chef at our table was entertaining. Good banter with the customers and we were never lacking for service.
5	pos	train	Captain Parkers is a wonderful, friendly experience for adults out for an evening or families grabbing a quick bite. The bar is great with very attentive bartenders. Captain Parkers has the absolute best clam chowder on the Cape!! Stop by and enjoy the true essence of Cape Cod.
5	pos	train	The atmosphere in a 1850 restored home was charming. The service was superb, and the food was out of this world. It's a limited menu of gourmet items including one fish, one foul, and one steak at least. I highly recommend this delightful little out-of-the-way place to locals and visitors to the Kansas City area as well.
5	pos	train	It is primarily a carry out restaurant, but the food is excellent. You get your money's worth. Real good soul food and the place is always crowded.
5	pos	train	I was in town for a recent weekend and I was taking a friend out for dinner who lives in Montreal. He selected Queue de Cheval and it was a wonderful choice. We did not have a reservation. I thought Sunday evening would be quiet but not at this restaurant. Thankfully the hostess was able to accomodate us with a nice table on the second level. The decor is a nice mix of old and new. The service was impeccable as was the food. I had a large steak and my companion had the lamb chops. The wine was a perfect compliment to the meal. The music was ecclectic as was the crowd. I cannot speak highly enough of this place.
5	pos	train	finally an authentic pizza parlor in South Florida - I am there 2-3 times a week - food is the best - quality - qualtiy - qualtiy
5	pos	train	Acting on several of our friends recommendations we ordered Flinger's Pizza Co. pizza last night. It was fabulous! It was our first time ordering so we checked out their web site http://www.flingerspizzaco.com. They have a great menu. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Flinger Rolls and the Cheese Bomb. Everything was awesome!! Flinger's Pizza Co. will be the only place we order from now on!
5	pos	train	This restaurant does not get the respect it deserves, ever since the attacks in New York on September 11 traffic in the airport has slacked off. Due to the lack of international travelers it almost always empty. The food is excellent! If you like Sushi you will fall in love with Ebisu. Ask chef Daisuke Shimiza for his recommendations, parking is free if you dine in the airport so if you are a resident of the San francisco bay area or just passing through the terminal and want some real Sushi stop by Ebisu. Check out thier website at www.ebisusushi.com
5	pos	train	the best Italian food I've had out side of Italy!! Try the Eggplant Canneloni, and the sauce-UNBELIEVABLE! The owner's take pride in everything from the greeting, to the fabulous infused vodka martini's, even bringing your food to the table! GET IN THERE!!
5	pos	train	The setting was absolutely beautiful. The dining room does indeed overlook a lake. but along with that the presentation of our meals was utterly incredible, with flavors that matched my expectations.
5	pos	train	It was great been back three times.
5	pos	train	I must say that I am shocked that others have given this hidden treat bad reviews. Not only is the food fabulous but the service, atmosphere, and overall vibe was exceptional. I have been there on numerous occasions and will gladly return to enoy the sushi, which is by far the best in town, and the delicious calamari. Everyone should be banging down the door to get a reservation there.
5	pos	train	They make the Ceaser Salad right at your table. The food is excellant. The service is great. They have a roving guitar player . EXCELLENT RESTAURANT
5	pos	train	We stumbled onto Gee Whiz quite by accident while walking. The food (we ordered Greek and Italian) was excellent and the service was absolutely over the top! Service people were a great source of interaction, jovial to those in a good mood and somber enough to a table near by which was more in a somber mood. The owner and I spoke a while after the meal and his interest was genuine and delightful. I cannot speak highly enough of the over all dining experience at Gee Whiz for your basic, average family out to have a good meal and a good time. Well done, Gee Whiz! Well done!
5	pos	train	Nice, Happy Atmoshhere - Very Small - Thrifty Seats- Wonderful Fresh Seafood
5	pos	train	We had a great experience in this Thai restaurant. The menu had many items, and the service very efficient despite the many customers having lunch on a weekday. This restaurant has an air of authenticity that's very pleasant, and finally the food is... delicious!
5	pos	train	We were walking down Bourbon Street looking for a Restaurant, because the one we wanted was closed due to a private party, when this voice beckons us over to eat. We walked inside this beautiful N'awlins Restaurant with a beautiful carved bar and woodwork and wrought iron gates, it was beautiful. Sammy was the most personal host with the best Crawfish Etouffe I have ever had. We also had the Fried Alligator tail for appetizer, and Sammy brought us warm bread to go with our meal. My companion had the Baby Back Ribs that were excellent. The sauce has a great flavor and the meat was falling off the bone. Later that night I recommended the restaurant to someone I saw from our flight down that morning.
5	pos	train	Great food - wonderful flavor. We took it to go and had some great wine with it. The person who served us gave very good descriptions of the various dishes to help us make a decision - even though we wanted some of everything.
5	pos	train	I think that 2 Rivers is the best restaurant in Lower Manhattan. I've been working here for years and am delighted to finally have a place like this. The food is fantastic and very reasonably priced. They have a great atmosphere and a really nice staff. They have different specials each day that are always to die for. I strongly suggest 2 Rivers to anyone looking to have some great food in a great atmosphere.
5	pos	train	The food and the service were excellent. The desserts are made by one of the wait staff and are also excellent. The owners take great care to ensure their customers are comfortable and happy. I have eaten in restaurants throughout the U.S., Canada and parts of Mexico. Dogwood Lane has been one of my better dining experiences.
5	pos	train	Beautiful place, and well worth every penny you spend and every minute you wait. Service is unbelievable.
5	pos	train	Excellent service and the food, SUPER! We didn't know that in Salt Lake City we were going to find a place that knows Mole Sauce like this place. They have 7 different moles and they all very good. Very busy place but pleasant and authentic. We go back anytime.. anytime we are in Salt Lake City.
5	pos	train	We aboslutely loved Chez Capo. Capo picked us up at our hotel and took us to his quaint restaurant. The food was wonderful. It was one of our favorite restaurants on our trip!
5	pos	train	The Market Place is wonderful, it is my favorite place to eat out. It is casual and still nice, and it is always a great place to take a date or a guest. Everything I have tried is wonderful and the menu has almost anything you want. The service is excellent.
5	pos	train	If you're a fan of Eastern North Carolina barbecue run, don't walk, to Bullock's. While the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill triangle is filled with 1st rate Q joints (Mama Dips & Allen & Sons get special mentions) Bullock's is a can't miss stop for anyone passing near Durham (Go Blue Devils!). Probably the best Brunswick stew I've ever tasted and fried chicken to put the Colonel to shameand don't foget the heaping pile of NC BBQ. Get the combo if you want to try it all or just pick your favorite and dive in. Save room for desert or you'll miss the full experience.
5	pos	train	WE VISITED SCHMIDT'S ON SEPT23.. WE WENT WITH MY WIFES SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW. WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA..WE WOULD DEFINATLY GO BACK AGAIN NEXT TIME WE ARE IN COLUMBUS. GREAT FOOD. RICHARD AND MILDRED HARRIS, MANTECA,CA...
5	pos	train	"With a corny name like ""Taco Temple"" I walked in with some preconceived opinions... Once I tasted the food that all went out the window QUICK! Those were the best carnitas and fish taco ever, the shredded beef was just ok, but better than most. The crazy salad concoction that they top their tacos with is the crowning glory! We had to sit outside because it was packed (at 2 in the afternoon) which , while inconvenient, is a testament to the food. Good thing the weather was nice and the view was spectacular. Our table gave it eight thumbs up!"
5	pos	train	Very romantic and beautifull. The atmosphere was phenomenal. The food was excellent. The wine list is extensive and the staff is very courteous and attentive. Great place.
5	pos	train	The best veggie sandwich!
5	pos	train	Fabulous!...until Dave Fansler left the establishment. Now it is barely O.K.. big mistake.
5	pos	train	"The spicy Dungeness crab was ""sooo good"" I went back a second time before leaving Seattle. Can be pricy, but worth every penny.... great atmosphere, excellent service, mind boggling selection. An oyster lovers heaven."
5	pos	train	IA good place for a quick bite or a large dinner. $20 will buy you enough food to feed an army. The pork bone soup is a speciality. But all the Korean staples are on the menu. I personally love the Bulgoki beef on rice. The decor is reminiscent of a soup kitchen and no-one speaks english at all. If you don't know korean you can only order by number, but the food is phenomenal. The open kitchen is magical. Completely authentic, delicious food, and constant chaos and shouting around you... not to be missed.
5	pos	train	If you love seafood as we do ,then bubbas is the place to go. It has great atmosphere, and the food and service was excellant. Located right on Monterey bay. Scenery is terrific. A fun place.
5	pos	train	One of the better restaurants we have been to within the state of new jersey, great food, service was outstanding, but thr atmospher was unbelievable !
5	pos	train	Marche Aux Fleurs is a Provence-style French Restaurant with a California twist. All the food is made with fresh, seasonal ingredients, and it is all fabulous. I don't drink wine, but their long and varied wine list has won awards. Don't know what you'd like? Ask the hostess, Holly Baker, and she will make wonderful suggestions. (Those who ordered wine at my table raved about her selections.) Start off with their seafood escargot--no snails, I promise! Consider the soup or a salad. I was amazed at how good squash soup was, but it's hard to compete with spinach salad with dried cranberries. For the main course, I'm a big fan of the pork chops, but they aren't always available. In that case, well, everything is good, so you can hardly go wrong. There is always a vegetarian option available, usually the pasta. The menu changes seasonally, so for me, it's never the same twice. That means new desserts to try! The fresh fruit options are always the best, so save room. Don't miss this gem of a restaurant located just north of San Francisco!
5	pos	train	"This place doesn't look like much from the outside. I might not have gone in except it was highly recommended. Once inside the nondescript building, the atmosphere is clean and sorta romantic. (When we were leaving at 8:30, it was packed and noisy, though.) The bottom line: The food here is great. If Olive Garden had this food, they'd eat it. There's your everybody's-got-it-Italian standbys, but this kitchen pumps out some well thought out specials. From the house made foccacia to the potato crusted salmon to the dreamy tiramisu, top quality is evident. The wine list has about 40 bottles, and just like the food, the pricing doesn't insult your intelligence. This is one of those nice ""surprise"" places to eat."
5	pos	train	We've been here 3 times. Everytime we stay at the Parker Hoouse B&B We come here. The food is first class and the atmosphere relaxed and peaceful. Was never rushed and the service was outstanding. Have had amny items on the menu and everything has been fantastic. Highly recommended.
5	pos	train	After having spent 5 nights on Tahiti and 1 already on Moorea we were beginning to wonder whether we would ever have a decent meal and then we went to Chez Capo. I had grilled Mahi Mahi and Bob had Ginger Shrimps. Both were BEAUTIFUL. It was also nice not to get fries as we were sick of them. It was the first time we had tried breadfruit and it was very pleasant. We found Capo, his daughter and other staff there very friendly and most obliging. We went back twice more and it was definitely our favourite restaurant while we were in French Polynesia.
5	pos	train	I have been eating this pizza since I was in high school almost 20 years ago, I won't eat anything else!!!!
5	pos	train	Skyline is great. Ludlow is one of the best. Watch out for the fake Cincinnati chili companies. There is only one Skyline chili.
5	pos	train	We started with Tapas and Sangria. It was great we could not pick a better restaurant , the service was friendly,the Tapas are the best I had in N.Y. and the Sangria was authentic the way it should be. I absolutely recomend this fine restaurant.
5	pos	train	Great place ,food was awsome with a choice of spanish and Italian on the menu,you have the best of both worlds. The staff was pleasent and the service better. I think its restaurant rows best kept secret.
5	pos	train	Most enjoyable evening!
5	pos	train	Very good. Great atmosphere, food and service. Wonderful entertainment as well Highly recommend! We'll be back
5	pos	train	As a former New Yorker, I can only say that Vito's is the Peter Lugers of the south. The 20 oz. Center Cut Filet Mignon is ......indescribable. The Appetisers and deserts are wonderful and the staff are all top of the line professionals. If you are a carnivore and come to Orlando you MUST try this restaurant!!
5	pos	train	I went with 3 of my friends on a Saturday night. Although they were out of some of the Stuffed Breads, I was able to have the Ham and Swiss Stuffed bread which was WONDERFUL!! We all kept commenting on how due to the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant we felt like we were actually on vacation for an hour. I highly recommend going, just don't be suprised if you go to late, and they are out of some popular menu items.
5	pos	train	Fresh bread served with tomato dipping sauce at seating. All homemade pastas. Salads are excellent. All fresh, made to order ingredients. Meals of gourmet quality. Magnificent presentation.
5	pos	train	If you like excellent Chinese cooking, then you should check out super buffet Chinese restaurant here in northern California. This makes our second trip to this fine place. The food is prepared very good. Nice clean establishment. Plenty of parking. Very reasonably priced. Great food.
5	pos	train	We are from Florida and while on vacation made a special trip to find this restaurant and it was well worth the trip. Our waiter Randy was great and the food excellant. I had elk and my husband had kangaroo. We shared and both were terrific. We will definately go again.
5	pos	train	This was the best restaurant Ive eaten in a very long time. It is a very quaint place that seats about 60 people and there is bicycle decor throughout. Bici is itailian for bicycle so they play off that theme. The food was prepared extremely well, the chef is certified through the American Culinary Federation and won a few awards at his last restaurant. The service was also excellent being a small place our waitress was always in view if we needed anything. This is the best restaurant in southwest Michigan, a must stop.
5	pos	train	The food here can be superb, especially on the weekends. Although it can be very crowded, I suggest late or early sittings. The best dishes they have IMHO are the butternut squash ravioli with browned butter and sage, the stone crab claws, the creme brulee cups, the chocolate covered strawberries, the fresh breads and the salmon. I swear the butternut squash ravioli with browned butter and sage is worth the 25 bucks alone to get in. I gorge myself on them every time!!
5	pos	train	It is a Turkish Restaurant. I believe it is the best Restaurant in the Triangle area.
5	pos	train	Holiday atmosphere, great decorations and wonderful food. Large menu and many specials, we orderded different selectons and had our own taste test. Every dish was a winner.Lobster Pie was ALL Maine talis no little pieces, never had that before! Haddock Oscar was fresh and light with lump crab (umbelivabely sweet & mild) and lobster tails. Prime rib perfect. Mussels Marinara falling out of an enormous dish. baked Stuffed Lobster (special not always on the menu) the best I've ever had. someone near us was eating BBQ ribs that were heaping off the plate and couldn't stop raving about how good it was. that's my choice for the next visit. service was great I think all I can remember was the delicious food.
5	pos	train	Excellent Restaurant the chef must be commanded.
5	pos	train	We eat there for lunch at least once or twice a week and love it. Won't go anywhere else anymore for Italian food. This is it...this is the best in all of Houston bar none, and that's all I gotta say.
5	pos	train	They're only open for breakfast and lunch now. I recommend the pancakes, but they will make anything you like if they have the ingredients. The service is fast and friendly and the food is really good.
5	pos	train	While dining at the quaint Dottie's Snack Bar, known locally as just Dottie's, I enjoyed a wonderful outdoor experience surrounded by warmhearted people, good food, great prices, and unbelievable service.
5	pos	train	"Simply put Bubba Burger makes some of the best burgers on the Island if not on the mainland! I ordered the Big Bubba a 1/2 lb of ground island beef so fresh it made me want to smack my mother! If they were on the mainland they would give ""In n Out"" burger a run for their money. If you ever make it to Kauai and you have a taste for a really good burger go to Bubba Burger. Their motto is ""WE CHEAT DRUNKS, TOURIST,DRUNKS & ATTORNEYS"" that motto is plastered on everything from mugs to sweatshirts, all joking aside they really do have great burgers, hotdogs and yes vegan burgers!"
5	pos	train	the moment you enter - the wonderful fresh smell of garlic and freshness- it's an old world /very classy Italian - bistro gourmet pizza place - super great music - a wonderful fun - quality place- with super tasting pizza - hey- they also have these coal fired chicken wings with onions and garlic - the meat falls off the bone - we also have their homemade ricotta cheesecake and espresso -
5	pos	train	Margarita ranch is a stylish, upscale, but unpretentious tex-mex restaurant that has a reputation for the best margaritas in town(true). They have a fantastic patio for hanging out and people watching and fabulous food (homemade tamales and flour tortillas) can't wait to go back.
5	pos	train	This restaurant is located in the heart of DC's 'steakhouse row'. The atmosphere is dimly lit and quiet, and many politicians and lobbyists dine here. The menu features a wide variety of basically everything (especially steaks, which are superb.) The prices, however, are the real kicker. almost every entree is $20.00 or more. We only eat here on special occaisions, but when we do, its always a great experience.
1	neg	train	Four hours after receiving rude service and mediocre food, my wife came down with food poisoning! We called the restaurant - they continued to be rude and unhelpful. Even our credit card company could make no progress with these folks. There are a lot of good italian restaurants in North Beach - avoid this one.
1	neg	train	"Okay, heres the deal...I moved here about 4 years ago and the was told to visit Tunni's ASAP. I did, and boy, was it fun! Every night the local hill residents made their way to this place for conversation, drinks and AMAZING food. The owner at the time, Current executive director of the washington restaurant association, Lynne Breaux, was always smiling and welcoming friends/ guests along with her popular charismatic staff. This place was the ""Cheers"" of Capitol Hill. It is unfortunate that the new owner or new general manager is not more aware of how they have damaged the Eastern Market scene by dulling and sterilizing this historic place. All notion of fun is GONE! 4 years ago when you walked through those doors on ANY given night there would be people playing cards, discussing politics, discussing bargains they found that weekend at the market, announcing engagements, etc. Local soccer leagues ( adult and youth) would be celebrating their wins or losses, and there was always a general feeling of community. Today....I wasnt sure if it was alright to speak at all, and no one was celebrating anything! Well, what was is gone and in the past but I cant help but wonder how an establishment that provided so many generations of Washingtonians and newcomers alike such a welcoming gathering place to meet and wind down, became the very place I dont want to ever go again...i wonder if they know that the experience isnt even a quarter of what it used to be, and that for the price of a single brunch I could walk across the street and buy the goods myself and feed a group. I never even looked at the prices before, I was too busy having fun!! A meal for one at Tunni's now...$15-30 A meal at Tunni""s Before...PRICELESS!! Take your Gramma ."
1	neg	train	Doesn't accept Amex. Food poorly cooked - items supposed to be hot were cold, even potato skins appetizer, soups, and entrees. Complained and all we got was come again and we'll do better! The waiter said he didn't know what was the matter with them 'back there' but he'd have the food heated up - put it in a microwave and returned it to us all soggy - just awful.
1	neg	train	Bartender was drunk. Food was burnt. Complaint fell on deaf ears.
3	neg	train	The Winston Salem site of this popular N.C. Chain is very similar to the others--- a highlight is the outdoor patio. They were featuring the Napa-Sonoma Menu--- many Salmon and mustard preparations. A pleasant appetizer was the Creole Eggplant.
2	neg	train	Not much to say, I won't be back. I should have followed my first instict....if a restaurant has nobody in it when you first enter...that usually reflects that the place is bad.
3	neg	train	You know you are at a good restaurant if the local police are dining there. Palermo is securely stapled to the Los Angeles dining scene. No place stands in comparison. I and many of my friends have been to Palermo many times. We go for the incredible pizza, but I here they also make a great lasagna. The atmosphere is busy. Palermo is not a secret to locals. You almost always have to wait, but no more than a few minutes. While you wait you are even offered free glasses of wine to hold you over. The maitre 'd is wonderful. The dining area is fairly bright and unorganized. There is alot going on here. Not very romantic; more like family friendly Italian. What does it matter. I go for the food. The parking is a problem with no solution. Generally, I do not pay for valet parking when the valets are in the very parking lot that they park the cars in. Especially, $5-10 valets. So, I spend many, many minutes driving around looking for a space in this very congested residential/commercial area of Los Feliz. There are many nearby bars, restaurants, and a movie theater so parking options are slim. But Palermo is still worth the anxiety.
1	neg	train	Very poor service, waited 30 minutes prior to even even served/ Food was poor, steak overcooked. Manager of store did nothing to rectify situation when approached
2	neg	train	For the tortillas, a waiter has to hand-pick the ones that will make it to a table, with disregard for hygiene. Since busboys are to take care of the drink orders, alcoholic beverages might not make it in time, since only waiters are trained to handle them. Other than that and the occasional messy floor, the diner is not so bad. The food is WAY sub-par considering I grew up eating authentic Mexican food, not Tex-Mex as it should be applied to this specific branch of dining. Alcoholic drinks, on the other hand, are taken care of with much more seriousness. Although the place is messy and the food is less than expected, the waiters do provide plenty of kindness and sincerity to make your dining experience enjoyable.
3	neg	train	Caribbean themed restaurant that offers open air dining as an option. Many seafood preparations are offered. Due to a big evening rush, this is a great lunch spot.
3	neg	train	Rustic Yankee Inn atmosphere. Very good food with average service. Ate here a half dozen times. One unfortunate Sunday brunch visit in the winter due to broken heatng system. Fires were going in the fireplaces, but unfortunately the place was still very cold. This ruined it for my English guest who was there for the first time.
2	neg	train	Biggest waste of a Friday night I've experienced to date. Awful waitstaff, rude and crass, Dick's Last Resort attitude minus the humor. Meat Market atmosphere outside the music area. Not someplace I'd reccommend unless intentionally seeing a band. About the only good part were two of the bouncers who were friendly but not to the point where you were questioning their motives. Wouldn't bother wasting my money there ever again.
1	neg	train	I was very upset about the way that we were treated. We were told that our server was new and she might need a little help with our order. That would have been quite alright if it hadn't taken her 45 minutes to serve us, and then another hour wait for our food. Our food was cold and dry and had no flavor or texture at all.
1	neg	train	Farrelli's has horrible food and it is way overpriced. The service was unfriendly and extremely slow. I would go out of my way not to eat at this restaurant.
2	neg	train	"Contrary to Popular San Diegan belief, Tapanade might as well be a brand of food you would find next to Wolfgang Puck's frozen pizza in Albertson's...(in La Jolla of course!) Put a La Jolla zip code on it and the wanna-bees and has-beens will coma a runnin'. To quote-just one of many not so observant, so-called reviews, ""The attention to detail in both the service and the food impressed me the most. And if you want to hear poetic descriptions of the food, ask your server. Our server was the type of man that believed whole-heartedly in his job, the chef, and his food. He was the type of man that was as enraptured by the flavors, the nuances, and the colors and we were. Looking around the room, I think the entire staff felt this way about Tapenade, ensuring you will have a fantastic experience at this La Jolla establishment. "" Hmmm...another review of a ""La Jolla establishment"" by another La Jollan. Imagine that! Don't get me wrong La Jolla is a beautiful part of San Diego. A host to a plethora of fine restaurants. But can someone please for a moment lose the Zip Code and actually write a realistic review of Tapanade. The service was bland and mediocre. The Food was bland and mediocre. Which, in turn, makes the overall experience bland and Tapande!"
3	neg	train	La FondueMore than just a meal. A true dining experience. It takes about 2 hours to eat a meal here, you will leave smelling and feeling greasy. This is a great restaurant for a group of people, yet it can get a bit expensive..
1	neg	train	"Although I had promised myself that I would never return to Bombay Bistro after being insulted by the OWNER, I was craving samosas- a popular Indian appetizer. Now, I realize there may be different regions of India where one Samosa may not resemble a samosa from another region, however, I have never eaten a samosa wrapped in a won ton and fried. On a previous occasion, I stopped in for a lunch buffet and was greeted at the buffet line by frozen vegetables in a curry sauce. But at a very reasonable price of $8.95 per plate!!! Right... I realize that rent is expensive in downtown Napa, but that is absolutely NO reason for skimping on quality of food. I'm not even touching the service factor, although that was the best part of my experience (and my order was wrong). Once again, I renew my vow, ""I will never visit Bombay Bistro again!"""
1	neg	train	If you like to pay a lot of money for mediocre, overcooked food drowning in cheap olive oil and buried in rank american Asiago Cheese, then this place is for you. It's certainly not for me.
1	neg	train	As first time customers, we had to find our own table. Ten minutes after we seated ourselves, no one came to our table to even give us menus although people who came AFTER us that were obviously regulars as shown by the kisses exchanged between their head waiter and the customers, were immediately seated, given their menus, and orders taken. We walked out of the place but not without letting their head waiter know what appaling service they reserve for people unknown to them.
2	neg	train	Very Dissapointed. Slow service after being sat rapidly. Wien we ordered was substituted (1998 Chianti Classico Riserva was ordered and 2002 plain CC was served with waiter insisting it was a CCR. I ate off the tasting meanu. For $60, I was served a small potion of one soft shell crab, a second course of 1-2 ounces of fish and 2 small asparagus spears, and a third dessert course, also very small. My companion did much better with a generous starter salad, and a nice ravioli main course. Don't get me wrong.. the food was well done, but the service, wine subsitution and poor tasting portions were a joke to anyone.
3	neg	train	The Gateway of India is an Indian restaurant that offers an all-you-can-eat Sunday lunch buffet for $7.95.My husband and I don`t normally eat Indian food,but we sometimes like to try something different.We have had Indian food once before at Thali in New Canaan, Connecticut about 2 years ago and enjoyed it greatly. Because of this we thought we would try Gateway of India. The food at Gateway of India was not bad, but was nowhere near as good as the food at Thali.It would have been a good idea for them to put signs on the food telling you exactly what was in each stainless steel serving dish as nothing was labeled.They had the salad and the rice pudding in opposite halves of the same serving dish.My husband thought that the rice pudding, which was a bit watery, was salad dressing and put it on his salad.You can imagine the look on his face when he took the first bite!I would have given it a higher mark for atmosphere,but this restaurant had two problems,one that was not their fault and one that was.The one that is not their fault is the fact that they are next door to a Pet Store.It was a little unnerving to hear a dog start barking while we were eating.At first we thought that they had a dog in the kitchen!It took us a moment to remember that there is a pet shop in the adjoining store. The second problem, the one that is their fault,is that the floor in their main dining room is sagging in the middle and walking across it just felt uncomfortable.
2	neg	train	I callled in 2 hours ahead and when I went in to eat the waiting area was over crowed and the host was very rude to me and my spouse. I asked him how much long it would be and he replyed by saying didn't I tell you before it would be 20 min. He never spoke to me. I informed Anne the other host of his rude behavior and she defended the host. I would never go back to flat rock and I would like to warn everyone who dares to eat there. The wait is terribly long and the employees are rude and flat out direspectful
3	neg	train	House of Sushi and Noodles has an all you can eat special for lunch (10.95). The sushi rolls are not very authentic but they are tasty. This is a great place for those that don't like raw sushi. Many of their rolls on the special are cooked (and involve cream cheese and cucumbers). The service was extremely slow and inconsistent. For the money this restaurant is a good value.
1	neg	train	We went there for breakfast and the hotel dinning room was closed for a baby shower. How do you close a hotel dinning room on a saturday morning? I won't give them a second chance, it was a waste of time.
1	neg	train	Service was terrible, waitress was a snob not a pleasant person at all. We absolutely NOT go back and would NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone! The owner should open his/her eyes and realize this..
3	neg	train	Kind of a fancy pizzeria. This place had it's day before pizza delivery was hot. Still not a horrible place, but not as hopping as it was when you took your family out to dinner at a pizzeria.
1	neg	train	bad steak, burnt tasting dessert, felt rushed.
1	neg	train	Here's the breakdown--June 05, 2004 Overall THE MOST expensive part of our Niagara vacation... We went here because we remembered the US version of this dining experience, be warned it is NOTHING like the US!!! Don't go here! Slim Slam Scrambled Egg Beaters®, a slice of grilled honey ham and two pancakes with blueberry or strawberry or cherry topping. Meat Lovers Skillet Diced ham, bacon and sausage over seasoned country-fried potatoes. Topped with shredded Cheddar cheese and two eggs*.

2	neg	train	10-15 minute wait ... that wasn't too bad. When we were seated, the kitchen was only about 15 feet to the right, and was open to all customers. The noise coming from the kitchen was outrageous, and made it difficult to hear others at our table. When the food was served, it was VERY bland, and not at all authentic, as they advertise. Very disappointing!
2	neg	train	I had a bad experience I found hair in my lunch entree and my partner did too. our food was warm but more cold. I asked the lady in the front why was my food cold and she said what does that have to do with me she was very rude I must say when I asked to speak to the manager she said they have the right to refuse service to anyone and if youre planning to eat there please beware of hair in your food and maybe the food will be cold you'll never know all I know is that mine was I would suggest you not to eat there but you will only understand if you experience it for yourself.
1	neg	train	After waiting in line for 40 minutes, we finally picked up our meals and were led to the hostess station where we waited another 10 minutes for a table. When a table was located, it had not been cleaned from the previous diners, so again we waited. We were sat behind a big pillar in the magicians room and caught the last 3 minutes of the act (which was nothing special). The food wasn't fit for my dog, it was horrible. The wait staff was non-existant and when our waitress finally came, it took her another 30 minutes to get back with our drinks. The food was bland, chicken tasted regurgitated, and the cheese was a cheap imitatation of velveta...disgusting!! After the meal, lack of entertainment, and service, I asked for our dessert to be canceled, game tokens refunded, and could not get out of there quick enough. We ran to the nearest store to buy some mints to get the taste out of our mouths. We then went out to eat at a real restraunt with entertainment, Dave and Busters. Don't waste your time or money on this place, it stinks!
1	neg	train	we had reservations for 9:00pm. at 10pm, we were still not seated because the resturant has over booked and didin't feel that we should be warned about it. they didn't even offer us a glass of water in the meantime, and suggested we go to another bar to wait. these people should not be in the hospitality business! they suck!
1	neg	train	"Oh. My. Goodness. Those are the three words I would use to describe this place.... The waitstaff? JUST PLAIN surly. Our friends (who shall remain nameless) had arrived early, asked to be seated since they wanted to start the evening off with a drink, and were DENIED a seat until the rest of us arrived! When it turned out that we had 5, not 4 people, in our party as previously thought, they set us at a table where the one additional person ended up sitting out in the walkway! The minimal portions of food and lack of variety were just the beginning... get this: at the very end of our evening, we were getting ready to take a picture (our friend was visiting from miles and miles away!) and as our friend started to snap the photo, the waitress proceeded to give ""THE HAND"" to the camera, walk briskly past, and huff away! Hm. sorry for getting in your way, ma'am..... I'm not one to ask much from waitstaff, but these characters were quite insulting, without saying a word! I'd say, try the Eliza's on Potrero Hill if you must, and do it during lunch- perhaps they're nicer then... but the Cal/Divis location has 1) Really nice bathrooms 2)cool decor 3) Free Hershey's kisses after your meal BUT all of this is countered by THE REALLY mean waitstaff!!!! I've been there a number of times, and this time was the last: I feel like I'm at the Principal's office!!!"
1	neg	train	Long wait in line, phony prices, were told a different price on the sign before we entered but found it that it was outrageously higher priced than anything weve ever seen..food was overcooked or just sat out there for too long....not sure..terrible experience,,,ya definitely need the cheap champagne they give ya just to swallow the garbage.
1	neg	train	"The restaurant has a really lousy EVERYTHING. The ambience looks like it should get remodeled really soon, one of the waiters dropped a huge chunk of meat on the floor next to my seat and it was not picked up for the whole hour. Don't be fooled by the ""all you can eat"" prices. They charge you for everything, including deserts. We paid $18.50 per person for buffet and ended up spending over $40 per person for the whole terible experience. I have been in several churrascarias in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and this does not even resemble the experience I had there. The food in Samba is cheep, undercooked, selection of salads and side dishes is more than poor, the atmosphere is really ugly. The sangrias were tasteless. The only decent thing I ate there was the desert, but we paid over $10 for it. Overall don't go there unless your life depends upon it!"
1	neg	train	"Awful...thankfully, I believe the same ""CHEF"" (Valerie Morris) that another reviewer complained about...is now GONE and no longer general manager/partner.....maybe she got canned! Maybe it will improve, but I doubt it"
1	neg	train	This was the very worst dining experience in all of Indian River County. The server was not up to the task of actually waiting on people. The restaurant itself was shockingly dirty, with debris on the floor AND table not bused , the server stations we saw were also dirty with funky stuff. All of this might have been ok had the food been at good. The garbage we were served was not fit for a dog. There were three other tables nearby which were also not happy. One table of three actually took off as our server was no where to be found. I can not say that I blame the other guest for leaving as we were about to do the same when our entrees finally arrived. We too would have complained if only we had had the opportunity to do so. As it was we never did see that particular server the rest of the night. We ended up paying our check (they were lucky) to another server who seemed very put out to have to do this for us. Needless to say we will never return. What is more, it is hard to fathom why so many people have raved about this place. In short, it really sucked!
3	neg	train	"Tragically, I no longer live on the HIll, but when I was a resident of Eastern Market / Capitol Hill, Tunni's was my ""Cheers"". I realize that the atmosphere/menu/owners have changed over time, but I always had a great time there, experienced excellent service, and always had fun. The only complaint I ever had was price. It's a tad expensive for what it is. However, given the fact that I was a solid regular and was on a social level with the entire staff and owners, I got to eat/drink a lot for free. Tis bliss. :)"
2	neg	train	"An experience I recently encountered at Dominic's Restaurant at Poplar Creek, a restaurant located on one of the local golf courses in San Mateo, California, appears to fall under the category of one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. It all started out fine. I was seated by the hostess at a table with a great view of the greens, I did notice that the table appeared to be soiled slightly, when I brought this to the attention of the hostess, who quickly dispelled my fears, stating someone had spilled a little something from one of the condiment jars. Fine, the stain was only about an inch wide so no big problem. The hostess took my drink order while I enjoyed the view of the ninth hole and the putting greens while waiting for my tee time. Now this is when everything apparently went south.... The hostess, who was pretty busy setting up a large table, stopped by my table to ask if my server had taken my order, ""not yet"" I stated, she then quickly departed to attempt to get my server's attention, however it appeared she too was unsuccessful, so I waited a little longer to place my breakfast order. Sometime during that wait, the hostess, finally decided to take my order on her own...I ordered the Steak and Eggs plate, I asked for Eggbeaters because I am on a low cholesterol diet. While waiting for my breakfast, I exited the restaurant to retrieve my sunglasses from my car and quickly returned. That is when the server approached my table and asked if I was ready to order. I asked her name and she told me her name was Lucy , I told Lucy that my order had already been taken by the hostess because by the time she noticed me, I had been there for quite a while. Lucy reappeared within several minutes with my order. The steak was excellent and cooked just the way I wanted it, but the Eggbeaters had one minor flaw, eggshells!! Now, how do you get eggshells into eggbeaters? I brought this small detail to the attention of the hostess, (I was at that point, unable to find Lucy again) she quickly apologized and removed my order... This is when Lucy re-appeared to inquire about the eggs, and then a few seconds later, the cook appeared at my table with my plate in hand to lecture me about how he had in fact, prepared eggbeaters not eggs, so there was no chance of there being eggshells in my food. So what was that crunchy stuff? All I can say is that I strongly believe eggs are not supposed to be crunchy, are they? I asked for the check and paid my bill, as I was being paged by the pro shop for my tee time. After a horrible game of golf, I returned to the restaurant to speak with the Manager regarding my earlier experience at their restaurant, I told her just what you have read in this article. I met Mitzi Page, who was the Manager on Duty, she was very apologetic and upon hearing my story, Mitzi promptly refunded the $14.38 that I had paid for breakfast, and presented me with a gift certificate for lunch for two. However, I will not be returning to Dominic's at Poplar Creek Restaurant anytime soon!"
3	neg	train	The people are friendly, however the sushi chef made 2 mistakes out of the 2 orders we made. Food tasted old. We probably will not go back.
2	neg	train	"This is an outrageously priced restaurant with no reasonably priced wines on the menu. Dinner for two with one of their cheapest bottles of wine set me back $365.00 and I had to pour my own wine! That being said you can just guess that I give them an ""F"" for service. If in DC and looking for a great place to eat, I recommend you look elsewhere. I will not dine at Marcel's ever again."
3	neg	train	A real (and welcome) departure for Ithaca -- strikingly modern dedor and creative menu (which, paradoxically includes what is far and away the best burger in town). Some locals may find it a tad pricey but we thought it compared favorably to Pangea, Madeline's, et al. Try it.
1	neg	train	The restaurant food was cold and tasteless, took too long to be served, could not get beverage refill, and waitress was slow in bringing check.
1	neg	train	They had valet parking and the employee who parked our vehicle never locked it so someone helped themselves to everything in our vehicle. This was right before Christmas so of course we had presents in there along with military dog tags, cell phone that was for my husbands company, and some Cd's. The owner isnt offering anything and says he's not responsible.The food was bad, the service was ok as far as the dining experience. For as much as they charge for their food and beverages, its really not worth it.
1	neg	train	Very disappointing experience for the money charged. The meat was overcooked and the staff / management were not friendly. The sauces lacked any real flavor I will never return and will tell others the same.
1	neg	train	They don't accept reservations, but they do take bribes. After a three hour wait we felt rushed to eat. We waited three hours and were rushed out in 20 min. Most of the food is pre-cooked and served cold. The wait staff was rude and while we were allowed to order an appetizer at the bar they brought the wrong one twice. It is a true tourist trap, with everyone saying that the wait is worth it, don't believe the hype. We wasted an entire evening of our vacation.
3	neg	train	Great made to order breakfast spot. Extensive selection of omelettes, skillets, pancakes and waffles. There is often a short wait for a table. Lunch is also served. Big assortment of gourmet sandwich creations. Wine and beer are available.
1	neg	train	One word - E X P E N S I V E ! ! ! ! ! Where did this Denny's come from?? We do Denny's in the U.S. all the time but never have we been gouged like this. We ordered breakfast - 3 grand slams with coffee and the bill after tax (before tip - a mismomer - WE DIDNT LEAVE ONE THE SERVICE WAS SO PATHETIC) was $42. Yes that's a 4 followed by a 2 in Canadian dollars about $30 US. We'll NEVER go to this or any Denny's in the Niagara area EVER AGAIN!!! We also checked out another one near the Hilton Hotel - which we were told was owned by the Hilton - and it was exactly the same expensive menu. For those prices, we'll eat AT the Hilton. There was another Denny's on Lundy's Lane but after seeing the other two, we wouldn't waste our time checking it out. Oh, almost forgot - the food was HORRID! Eggs were not as ordered and we were told the cook couldn't do it the way we asked?? Excuse me?? What kind of a cook can't poach an egg for crying out loud? We were politely TOLD to take it or leave it unless we wanted to reorder and pay for it as well. That was the last straw and we ate and ran, probably what they wanted us to do anyway.
1	neg	train	Not sure what has happened. Service is Lousy, food is worse, cook can't get and order cooked right. Will not return!!!!
3	neg	train	You can probably go into this restaurant for years and get great service, but I'm going to put this story online and mail it to the owner: When I went in a few months back and found a roach head in my salad, the red-headed manager clearly handled the problem less seriously because I went out of my way to be polite about it. She took off 15% ($5). It is standard for a restaurant to comp the meal with a health code issue such as this, but I would have been happy had she offered a free dessert on top of 15% off. After paying, I gave the bill back to the manager and told her I wanted her to fix the ticket the way she would have had I caused a scene. She knew exactly what I meant and comped the meal. I gave the place a second chance and encountered nasty looks and a catty attitude from her. (The other staff is top-notch.) She even sat at a table with a blonde friend or coworker (I couldn't tell which) and retold the story about how ridiculous I had been. I doubt she realized how loud she was being. On my way out, both looked up to sneer; both laughed the minute my back passed them. If I wanted to spend time around this kind of immature behavior, I'd go back to high school. Normally I handle problems by going directly to the person and work it out like an adult, but I've already tried it in this case and found I was not dealing with a grown-up.
1	neg	train	I'm sure the idea looked good on paper, but pass of the sushi here. Well, if you're drunk, you won't care...
2	neg	train	Not worth waiting 3 months for the reservation. Rude service staff, wine was marked-up about 200%, and food was brought cold. The experience was not worth the $1300 we spent that evening. I would rather go to Cafe Absinthe for better food service and atmosphere at about half the price. I am very unsatisfied with Tru.
1	neg	train	My husband had heard about this place & wanted to see what it was like. It is near the Stockyards & that should have told us something! It was a dump on the outside! The inside was a little better. Poor parking, & when we got inside, we found they were not happy we didn't have a reservation, so, they stuck us in the back where it looked like they hadn't updated it-ever! (We were unaware we needed a reservation HERE!) The waitress wasn't very friendly & seemed a little impatient with us. The bus boys hovered & made us feel uncomfortable during our dinner. Like they wanted us to hurry & leave. The food was just barely ok. The steak tasted like it had only been processed for a very short amount of time. Not 'aged' properly. Now, Kansas City is known for its beef & BBQ. Please don't let THIS restaurant be the yardstick upon which all restaurants are measured! Take my advice, if you want good beef & bbq-stay away from this place!
1	neg	train	"AVOID THIS DIVE AT ALL COSTS!! Geddy's would appear to be a typical, small family restaurant, specializing in obscure pizzas. In reality they are a ""lounge""-- not even a restaurant! Not appropriate for families, children, -- pretty much to be avoided. Over priced. Awful, rude waitstaff. The hostess is tactless and self-important. There are too many good restaurants in Bar Harbor to waste your time in this place!!!"
1	neg	train	I stayed as a guest in the hotel and ordered the Baked Herbed Salmon. I swear it tasted off when I started, and for some reason I didn't send it back. I was alone and in a hurry, etc. Later I was ill. It was crap. And the rice with it was mush also.. I sat near a window and on top of the food experience, someone had either dropped a wad of saliva on the window sill or it was mass of something worse, roughly the mass of three quarters tossed carelessly to the floor. It was very visible to patrons and quite disgusting. All in all, I really couldn't believe my experience there. I should have complained, yes, I should have complained or at least brought it to the attention of the manager. But like the majority of patrons I did not say anything, just logged it away as an awful dining experience, and a place I would never return. Rant - In this kind of establishment, what kind of idiot serves rice turned to mush? Overcooked, just this side of mashed. It was fit for school cafeteria and nothing more. The ice-cream scoop shape should have tipped me off! At least my employer picked up the tab - $36 of indigestion. I almost wrote them up on my website but they aren't exactly in my area of expertise, so I'll avoid reliving the experience just for the sake of an article. There are better places to eat here in the boondocks, and places that could benefit much more from the exposure.
1	neg	train	We arrived at 7:00 pm. Even though the restaurant was 60% empty we were seated at the smallest table behind the spot where they clean the dirty dishes. When we asked for a more comfortable spot the host told us that all the other tables had reservations. There were at least twenty empty tables. We reminded the host that we, too, had made reservations. The hosts next excuse for not seating us somewhere decent in his empty restaurant was because the other reservations (for the people not there yet) had been made days in advance. We were so insulted by the rude behavior we left without eating anything. Who cares what the food tastes like if the treatment is so bad.
3	neg	train	Nice, quick meal. Very friendly wait staff. The food's not the greatest, but if't not bad. If your in a hurry, it's well worth it.
1	neg	train	I'm huge fan of japanese cousine. Unfortunately this place doesn't have the traditional atmosphere of japanese restourant. I sure expected better service. Waitress kept refreshing my glass with water which I didn't touch at all! I wish she'd took care of my tea instead :) Food was average and defenetely not up to price.
2	neg	train	I eat here often because there aren't a lot of vegan restaurants, but the service is sooo bad! Once I was there and a cook got off duty, sat at a table next to ours to eat a meal, and screamed a conversation with the other guys behind the counter for our entire meal. Very annoying. The staff just hangs out behind the poorly designed cash register/drinks area. (Valencia Herbivore.) Forget getting a second glass of wine! I'm not looking for 5 star service, just a little actual service would be nice.
1	neg	train	Horrible!!!!
2	neg	train	"For some unexplained reason we must have offended the staff as they gave us far inferior service than they did our neighbors to the left and right (who, by the way were sitting so close that we know every intimate detail they were discussing). There was so much staff that it resembled an ant hill in full frenzy, yet we only got served by the lowly busboys. Our neighbors got full explanations of all their food and the history thereof, and cutesy comments like ""this is compliments of the chef"" or ""for the lady"" while we just got things slapped in front of us. After our neighbors left, their bills sat on the table for several minutes. They scooped ours up the second they saw us put money down. Why? Who knows -- perhaps they detected that my skirt was purchased at Ross Dress For Less. Even if the terrible service hadn't been so insulting, we wouldn't return; the food was overpriced and frankly not that good. There was a $2400 bottle of wine that sounded yummy. Don't waste your money on this place!"
2	neg	train	I had originally come to the Hudson Buffet because of the advice of a relative of mine. For years and years, I had always eaten at either the Imperial Buffet or at the Chan's Peking Takeout restaurant. When I went to the Hudson, however, I realized that the food was the worst I had ever tasted. Service was okay. The waittresses were polite, if not slightly cold. It seemed a busy day and I expected everything to be as good as I was told. I was in for a shock. The buffet was utterly icy cold and the food was hardened at stale as if they were merely fried rocks. Everthing looked a mess with and the food tasted utterly disgusting. I had left as soon as I could, not saying anything to anyone and feeling ashamed that I had taken my friends to such a terrible restaurant. On to a McDonald's, we all agreed that the Hudson Buffet was a terrible place to dine. Later on, I went on this website and saw all the praise for China Buffet. Since the Imperial Buffet is closed, I went to try it out and found that they served Lobster, Maine Crab, and Snow crab legs for dinner! They had delicious cakes and a salad bar to rival any other buffets. I also found their Honey Chicken and Lo Mein very delicious. The staff was courteous, polite, and helpful as usual, always full of smiles and I met a new nice waitress there that was very pretty and kind. Her name is May. personally, I would rate the China Buffet as one of my best and the Hudson as one of my worst. Maybe I had just gotten there on a bad day, but I will never return there again.
1	neg	train	"We arrived New Years Eve at 6:25 for a 6:30 reservation. We checked in with the host and were seated at exactly 6:30. So far so good I thought, however we sat 15 minutes and not even a glass of water was brought to our table. We observed several other tables be seated and were quickly attended to by the staff. My wife went to the host to ask if our table was assigned? He said he would take care of it. Well 5 more minutes passed and two other tables were seated and were immediatly served that we said we had enough. We got up to leave as we passed the ""host"" we informed him that we were leaving. His reply was ""I told them"" and followed by offering us a drink. We said ""No thank you"". We felt disgusted and appalled by the way the situation was handled. We went to a local eatery and told our tale to several friends who were eating there. We learned from them that they and several other couples they knew had also walked out of the place. In all our years of dining, WE HAVE NEVER WALKED OUT OF A RESTAURANT."
3	neg	train	Overall, it was a good meal but I expected better because of the recommendations I received. Service was good.
1	neg	train	The employees at Tobies are not very pleasant. Most seem tired, rude,depressed or crabby. When asking to speak to a manager she (Suzie, the owner) was as equally unpleasant as her staff.
3	neg	train	The Dragon Buffet offers a $5.99 Sunday brunch buffet which includes a fairly large variety of dishes,including fairly good sized cocktail shrimp. While nothing on their buffet really stands out as being exceptionally well prepared or flavorful, due to the wide assortment of offerings everyone should be able to find something that is to their liking.The food actually deserves about a 3.5 rating.Their parking lot definitely leaves something to be desired due to the difficulty of maneuvering in it.
2	neg	train	I know that there are new owners at The Bayport House, and I tried to give them a break, but the food was cold and it took forever to come out. The previous owners didn't have a clue for so long. So, I didn't really expect much. I have not had a decent or deliciously meal in Bayport, Blue Point, Patchogue or Sayville in a very long time and I have been everywhere. Is it the water or the people? Especially, Patchogue. There are three or four new ones and they are horrible.
1	neg	train	"This dive came recommended by a friend... I think she must have been mad at me that day... LOL... You order your food, then get crammed together with other people. The ""cooks"" holler out what they have on the plate, and if they hear you scream first, you get it!!! I have also heard reports from delivery men that the kitchen here is the dirtiest they have ever seen anywhere... Dropped meat is cooked and served, floors are greasy and dirty, rats, mice, and bugs have been seen in the kitchen area, also... definitely not a place I'm going to be returning to!!!"
1	neg	train	"We were on vacation in pigeon forge, tn. and stopped there to have breakfast and my husband was very upset because he asked the waitress if he could have his eggs anyway he wanted and she said ""Yes you can"". Well when he went up to the cook who was fixing the eggs he replied, "" I don't know what an egg over easy is"". That is what my husband wanted. He was really upset. So the rest of the group felt bad for him. I don't know if we will ever come into a Golden Corral again while we are on vacation. It really was a waste of our money. So the next time we ate out for breakfast we went to Pondarosa for their buffet and it was good."
1	neg	train	Absolutely awful! I am from New Orleans, Louisiana and have eaten MANY times at HOB and have gone to HOB SIN night all my adult life. The gumbo was awful. The roux was burnt and then when I complained the waitress told me it was an acquires taste. I told her are you kidding me?? I am from NOLA and make my own roux and it is b-u-r-n-t. Period. The food was all wrong. It tasted like the chef had his training at McDonald's. That man had no business cooking Cajun food. The waitstaff was also rude and it was like pulling teeth to take the gumbo off the bill when I insisted they take it away. I live in Vegas now and I will never go to HOB again.
1	neg	train	We had a bad dining experience here on 12/27/01. Service took 45 minutes for initial contact. We asked for inside, they put us outside. Food was cold, or burnt. It was evident that they were understaffed. Management did not want to hear our concerns and answered with profanity and abuse. This place relies on location (Old Town) and not service or quality. Mark it down as a tourist trap.
1	neg	train	Possibly the worst restaurant experience my colleagues and I have ever had. We were treated like prisoners of war from the moment we entered the James Hotel, where Fiamma Restaurant is located. The hotel and restaurant staff's attitude is like some charicature of rude new-yorkers played by bit actors in so many horrible B-movies.Surly, insolent, and downright rude best descibes the staff. The drinks and food we had were mediocre at best - and we all decided we would never come back.
1	neg	train	The place was filthy. The food was undercooked and rotten. Only when the servers were done picking at food and talking did they decide to served us. You could hear people swearing and yelling from the kitchen. Not a place I would recommend to anyone who would like a nice evening out.
2	neg	train	This was one on the worst lunch experirnces I've had in a long time. Overpriced, bland, generic food, and terrible service. My friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich which was served cold on a plain roll. We saw the staff heating it in a microwave. Apparently it was not heated long enough. Absolutely terrible.
1	neg	train	What an awful place. We were on vacation at the Jersey shore with the kids and this was bad from beginning to end. When we walked in the hostess was not very nice when she told us we would have to wait (our first clue this wasn't going to be pleasant). We then sat at the bar to wait and the bartender was the nastiest woman I had ever seen behind a bar, and it was all she could do to pull herself away from her gossip session with another worker. We were surprised that the food was so expensive but we figured it would probably be good since we read that it was family owned. Wrong again-the steak was way overdone, and when we asked for it to be cooked to the right temperature we were met with more attitude. My husband had a veal dish which tasted like shoe leather. When he asked for the linguini (which is included in the dinner price as a side dish) to have the same sauce on it as his veal dish instead of the red sauce, we later found out they had charged us $8.00 for it-this was the free linguini with the same sauce as the veal-not like they had to make anything extra. The kids got ckicken, which they couldn't eat because it was raw in the middle-again-when this was pointed out to the server he acted as though we were asking him to do us a favor by bringing us edible food. Not to mention our having to isten to the kitchen staff fight and curse at one another through our whole meal. The deserts looked pretty lame so we decided to just cut our losses and get out of there, but once outside we were treated to the lovely sight of one of the cooks pushing his girlfriend (or wife) who also worked there around and calling her some names that were awful. This place has no class-the food was horrible and overpriced. Later in the week we had dinner at another local place called Alphie's and someone at the bar there told us they were a local and everyone kind of stays away from Chiarella's because of the trailer park ambience. If this review saves one family of having to deal with the nightmare me and my family had to endure on our vacation the it is doing it;s job.
3	neg	train	A refurbished house in the downtown section of Montomery. The contrasting earthtones provide for a nice dining ambience. The menu offers beef, seafood, and poultry; in additon, there are chef additions nightly. The desserts are large enough to share.
3	neg	train	"Rusty Scupper is tucked away from the commercial buzz of the Inner Harbor, yet you still get the experience of being part of the action, without the hassle--- a major plus for this high-end' take on the Phillips Seafood genre of seafood restaurants. Just a stroll away from Federal Hill, with ample parking surrounding the area and its own garage for restaurant patrons only, it is a welcome incentive to a relaxing evening. My Rusty Scupper experience starts with calling in for reservations. Hostesses were curt and drab, without the effort of being hospitable; they asked for any special requests, and when I requested a water view table, she said it was no guarantee. Upon inquiring about the dress code, twice I was advised---dressy casual--- ""so, no jeans, no shorts?"", ""Yes"" she said. Needless to say, close to 98% of the patrons were in shorts, jeans, flip-flips. Obviously a tourist attraction I should have known. However, they redeemed themselves with the complimentary fresh herbed focaccia-like bread, crusty on the outside, deliciously light inside. This, offered with a Roasted Red Pepper, Garlic and Olive Dip, made me forget about the aforementioned shortcomings that occurred. Though visually dismal--- ""it looks like thousand island dressing!"" my hubby quipped--- the dip was very complex, with layers of flavors tickling your every taste bud. We tried a popular local choice for our appetizer--- the Artichoke and Crab Dip (10.95) offered with Crispy Pita Chips. The dip once again, fabulous! Chunks of artichokes and lump crab with every scoop; the pita crisps, though, were mostly over-fried, close to burnt. But that dip! The entrees were less than impressive, not following through from the excellent starters we experienced that night. I had the Authentic Maryland Crab Cakes (27.95 for two cakes) with mashed potatoes and ""fresh"" vegetables; my hubby had the Fresh Swordfish (23.95) with a wild rice medley and ""fresh"" vegetables. Both dishes were mediocre, uninspired and over-priced. The Crab Cakes salty, the vegetables wrinkled and over-cooked; the Swordfish was half-moist, half-dry, with the vegetables far from fresh. Nothing special from what I had expected, from an establishment claiming to be less commercial than Phillips Restaurant. The dessert menu was the usual: a cheesecake, a fruit tart, a chocolate selection, an ice cream selection, and of course, creme brulee. We did not try any. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to tourists, not the local crowd. An experience of the waterfront, with a relaxing environment after a full day of activity, this is perfect for the out-of-town guest. For the locals who want to re-discover the harbor, plan for just cocktails and appetizers, and have dinner elsewhere. AMBIANCE: very soothing and romantic; relaxing and laid-back. Be wary of the touristy feel, though. DECOR: Multi-level, Wood, dim lighting, framed pictures of local Maryland lighthouses offer a nostalgic feel. Quaint. PRICE: Expensive for mediocre food and mediocre service. SERVICE: Overall Dismal. Friendly, if it means being efficient; hostesses/hosts not welcoming. Long wait for appetizers and main entree. MENU: Pedestrian, Uninspired. Run-of-the-mill harbor side restaurant selections"
1	neg	train	My first contact with Openas Restaurant was September 2004. My wife (at that time she was my fiance) and I visited Openas to contract them as caterers for our wedding. We consulted with them, decided on a package, and placed a refundable deposit. The next day we telephoned the restaurant to clarify some items in our package. We could not come to agreement on several items and realized that this clarification should have been done during our face-to-face meeting the previous day. We acknowledged this and decided to switch to another caterer. I telephoned Openas to cancel our package and return the deposit. Their policy is a return of 75% of the deposit for any cancellation. I was quite surprised to hear them tell me that a return of the deposit was not forthcoming. We were bound to use them and they refused to return any portion of the 50,000 peso deposit. Subsequent telephone calls to Openas that week were ignored. We were told only three days after placing the deposit that they no longer had the money. They refused to speak with me and terminated the phone conversation. Subsequent phone calls have resulted in abrupt terminations and they refuse to discuss the matter. This matter is now being pursued legally.
2	neg	train	"Brunos is the Venus fly trap of yuppie jazz concert goers. Bruno's, a long time respected jazz venue and restaurant is newly remodeled and looking great. However, they have miles to go with their service. The waiter was nowhere to be found, unless you walked outside where you would catch him taking a smoke break. We had to grab his attention for everything and when we asked for better service he made the rude remark, ""Don't get snappy with me."" We ended up spending about $400 for a dinner that came over a three hour period. Can you say, ""DRAG."" They were attempted to fulfill the Italian food angel and failed. They did not pepper our salads nor offer parmesan for our pasta. A huge lack of attention to detail was the theme. The music was wonderful, featuring Ledici, a classic soul singer. However, they packed some many people into the poorly designed venue that one could not move without dirty looks flying. So if you are into fulfilling your Yuppie dream, go ahead and dine at Bruno's. Make sure you allot a few hours to compensate for their slow service and get there early so you can find a spot to enjoy the show. Otherwise, much like a Venus fly trap, the place will eat you alive and you will leave wanting more."
1	neg	train	I had such high hopes for Timpano. From the first moment I walked into this Italian Steakhouse I loved it. I loved the decor, the music, the foccacia served by the waiter while we perused the menu. Had the food been as good as the decor and atmosphere, everything would have been perfect, but alas, the food did not measure up. Timpano calls itself a moderatly priced restarant, however, when two people spend $60 without buying any beverages, that is a bit more than moderate. Add to this the fact that everything on the menu is ala carte, that $60 bought a couple of entrees and two caesar salads. When I spend 60 bucks on dinner, I want a dinner that is tasty. The night we went dinner was anything but tasty, it was horrid. My wife ordered the Tuscan Style Brick Chicken. As our waiter John explained, This is a boneless chicken, pressed between two hot grill pans and cooked. It was served with mashed potatoes. My wife doesn't like eating chicken out because much of the time it is undercooked. One again she was proven right, her chicken was half cooked on one side. I ordered the 12 ounce bone in sirloin strip. Prior to ordering I asked John if the kitchen could cook the steak medium well without either drying it out, or burning it. He assured me that this was a chop house which specialized in steak and of course they could. I bravely ordered. I will give them this, they did not dry out the steak, however the outside was burned beyond recognition. I can only attribute this to cooks who either leave the steak directly on a flame for the full cooking time out of ignorance, or out of spite that some customer would dare order a steak any way other than rare. In either case, a $19 steak was dreadful. And what about those two ceasar salads? I have eaten ceasar salads around the world and this one ranks as the worst, saltiest, caesar salad I have ever had. But I loved the foccacia. I loved the music and the decor. I hated everything else except the service. John was great, but we didn't have the heart to tell him how bad things were since he was such an enthusiastic guy. And to top things off, the $5 valet took forever to get our car when we were leaving. Had there been several people waiting, or if the valet needed to run several blocks to get the car, the quarter hour wait might have been tolerable, but there was no one else and the parking lot was right there. Would I return to Timpano? Not if the meal was free.
3	neg	train	A local chain in the Charlotte, NC area. Orders are placed upon entering. The menu is a large board. THe offerings range from burgers,salads, and soups to gyros and pita sands. After ordering the friendly waitstaff brings the food to your table. Good spot for lunch or a quick casual family dinner.
3	neg	train	The food was pretty good but it wasn't as good as I had expected. The salad thing, though, the whole pretentious twirling thing they do somewhat annoying..just because the salad tasted and looked like what we get from California Pizza Kitchen. Overall, I won't complain about the quality of food but I do think that the restaurant is somewhat overrated.
1	neg	train	The first time we went to Galileo 3 years ago, the experience was horrible. There were 3 big parties in the room with one English-speaking waiter. We waited forever for our meal which was OK, but not spectacular by any means. Service was awful; we had to ask three times for the salt! The check however was spectacular. Yesterday we decided to try Galileo again since critic's reviews are still very good (I wonder about it). Nothing changed. Service was awful-the third bottle of wine we didn't order magically appeared on our table, orders were mixed, we were not asked how we want our meat cooked. Portions were tiny, food was mediocre at best. Even though it is restaurant week with $30.04 price dinner, we recently dined at La Miche and Blacks in Bethesda for $25.00 from anniversary and pre-theater menu-it was full dinner and much tastier. Never again!!!
2	neg	train	WATCH YOUR CREDIT CARD CHARGE. THEY MORE THAN DOUBLED MY AUTHORIZED TIP AMOUNT WHICH WAS OVER 15%.
3	neg	train	An in-town fun food place, known for its kettle of soup on a spit on an open fire. Great for families---attentative owners take care of you.
1	neg	train	Recently,oue experience at the Yardarm was a fiasco at best.after waiting for a full 10 minutes before we saw our waitress,it took another 10 to get our drinks .we place our order early,and asked the waitress to let the kitchen know of our order, but to take thier time.half hour later,(after seeing people who had just come in recieve thier orders-whiche were what we had ordered)the waitress came over and told us that they were out of one of the items that our party had ordered.yes..the people next to us were eating our dinner.then,she never brought the salads.to top it off,the shrimp scampi was nothing more than store bought pre-cooked shrimp, arranged on top of very soggy linguine,topped with chunks of garlic and oil.no garnish,no herbs and spices, no parmesean!a true disaster!
2	neg	train	"I had previously had fair experiences with this place before but now I will never go back. The overpriced food should at least ensure above average service. But it didn't. The waitress couldn't remember who ordered what, then most of the table had to reorder after already sitting there for 20 minutes, next she brought our orders out at separate times, lastly my plate was the most expensive and yet it was a very simple item to make which I had before and just by looking at it I could tell that it was terribly over cooked. At this point I had lost my appetite with the attempt to eat my food. I ended up not eating much of anything and by the time I had received my food everyone else was nearly done eating and it was pointless to get them to remake my food. On top of all of this the waitress had the gall to complain about the modest tip that was left for her as a hint of ""you are not doing you job"" which I overheard her say while passing the kitchen."
3	neg	train	Somewhere between Ragu and real itialian. While the pasta is generally ok, avoid some of the specialty items. I received the worst veal marsala of my life. The waitress was apologetic but I was still stuck with the meal. My wife received a reasonable alfredo but be aware that its a flour based white sauce dish rather than the cream and parmesan cheese dish that I really enjoy. Don't order the steak. The pizza is pleasant but different. They use some herbs which the kids won't like. i think this place is popular because its reasonably priced and still the best restaurant for some distance.
2	neg	train	A few co-workers and I visited this restaurant about a year ago. We were seated in a crowded area where we had to lean forward if anyone wanted to get to the restrooms and were served by a waitress who acted like your typical high school bubblegum-chewing teen...and she had to be at least 40. It was obvious she thought she had better things to do than serve us. I ordered the spaghetti with meatballs. The sauce tasted funny, as did the meatballs. Really funny. Rotten, almost. I only ate about half of the spaghetti, paid my bill and left. The next morning, I woke up with incredibly bad food poisoning. I have never been so ill in my life. I hadn't eaten anything after the spaghetti that day so the obvious cause of my food poisoning was the rotten sauce and raw ground meat. I will never go back there again! Please...if you eat there, do not get the spaghetti w/meatballs. You will be sick beyond your wildest dreams!
3	neg	train	Average visit to a microbrewery. Everyone at the table except me had the Shepherd's Pie and raved about it. The fish and chips that I had were good.
2	neg	train	eh...it's there. Usually, I'm all for mom 'n pop;s over chains, but your better off finding a chain store for your chicken around here.
1	neg	train	The 80 items this restaurant claims to have on its all-you-can-eat buffet is a gross exaggeration, but to say that the twenty or so dishes on display when we were there were inedible is not. Initially, we thought we were the only patrons at the height of the lunch hour due to its location - nearly at the end of a strip mall (set well back and out of view from the main drag), where the primary draw is a discount dollar store. We quickly discovered that we were probably the only ones there because everyone else who had tried it knew not to return and had warned everyone they could to stay away. Nothing looked fresh, and everything tasted like reheated leftovers from the previous day. How else to explain the stir fry dishes with vegetables the consistency of mush? The soups were thin and tasteless. Pot stickers were dry and rubbery. A pork roast that looked fatty and undercooked inexplicably lay in a pan of greasy water instead of on a carving board. Most of the selections were lukewarm at best. We avoided the seafood and sushi, suspecting the worst. Dessert included stale cream puffs and ice cream coated with freezer burn, further suggesting that few people had eaten there in recent times. Our negative comments to the owner as we paid the check were met by a blank stare. To add insult to injury, all of us suffered severe intestinal distress within an hour after leaving, despite the fact none of us finished eating any one of the items we had selected. Avoid this one like the plague!
1	neg	train	We brought friends for a special night out. The location is delightful but the meals were bland and not very creative. It was an expensive evening out for such a dreary dining experience.
2	neg	train	We were disappointed with our dining experience from the time that we set foot in the restaurant. The bartender made it a point to snub our party and made innappropriate comments before our drinks were even ordered. While being seated, a sophomoric hostess decided that it would suit her better to talk to another nearby table while giving us our menus, never speaking to us ,with exception of noting that our server would be with is shortly. For appetizers, we ordered dumplings and lettuce cups. No major complaints. Dinner consisted of kung pao chicken and mongolian beef, at the servers recommendation. The chicken was suitable, however the meat in the mongolian beef was not lean and very tough. Our server was polite, but even as he noted, his service was slow. This restaurant pales in comparison to a long established restaurant of its kind: P.F.Chang's China Bistro. What a travesty that Iron Wok is making a mockery of such a dynamically opposite, yet similar restaurant type and style. If you would like a remarkable dining experiece of this sort, check your local listings for a P.F. Chang's China Bistro near you!
2	neg	train	I would definitely have to agree with the first review. The food is decent. As I'm still relatively new to the area, I'm still trying to find my 'favorite' place to get my weekly dose of mexican. The prices - also reasonable. The atmospere - who cares, I always take it to go. The service - whoa, the service is TERRIBLE!!! I know exactly who this guy was referring to; the lady behind the counter with the snotty look on her face. I've been in there 4 or 5 times, and every time I've been in there she's got this pissed off expression on her face. In all honesty, I should've given them a 3 on service as the other lady always seems pleasant and there's a guy who works there at times who always seems upbeat and cheerful. But it's that angry-at-the-world lady who dragged the service score down to a 1.
2	neg	train	This restaurant is a typical Irish pub. The menu items were plentiful but they did not have all items in stock and kept having to apologize. I ordered a chicken sandwich with bbq sauce and it came doused in mayo. the waitress never came back to check on us until we were finished. Portions were tiny and towards the end of the meal I saw a roach climb out of a hole in the wall. I feel truly discusted after eating there. The one good quality was an excellent pint of Guinness!
2	neg	train	The food was mediocre, especially for the price. Spent $120+tip for, appetizers 2 dinners & 2 drinks! We actually had to tell our waitress that we were ready to order our entrees, and we had already finished our appetizers! She was condescending at best. No matter how good, wouldn't return for the price or service!
1	neg	train	"I had a gathering there of about 25 people. They would not let my friends pay as they go, so I opened a tab. Long story short, they snuck in a 4th bottle of vodka to my party and charged me for it. I did not authorize it or order it. I called everybody and neither did my friends. Of, course we drank it, as it was late in the night, and what is going to happen to a bottle of open vodka in a party situation? They know. That's why they did it, I assume. Boost sales? Increase tip? I have no idea. I called the next day to have it removed and credited to my card. In a sober state of mind. They were nasty, trying to make it look like I was trying to get away with something. ""You signed the credit card, honey,"" was what I got, in the most condescending, machismo manner. In my 12 years in NYC I NEVER experienced such sneaky behaviour from an establishment. Horrible service and unethical practices. Shame, shame, Pop Burger. What goes around comes around."
3	neg	train	A great and cheap place to go for lunch...will try dinner...
1	neg	train	We live here and have only eaten here when out of town guests demand to go. It's a true tourist trap. Stone crabs were like rubber...mustard sauce is flavorless. Key Lime pie is good. Service was rushed and rude. Save time and money and go to Publix (local grocery) and get 5 lbs of Stone Crabs for 1/10th of the price and a pint of mustard sauce. Get their Key Lime Pie and you'll and eat at home or on a blanket on the beach. FAR cheaper and more enjoyable experience.
1	neg	train	We have been to this establishment before, and every time we return it is better. When there is no need for improvement, they always seem to find a way. The entrees are as pleasant to look at, as presented as a piece of artwork. Portions are generous, as well. I will keep this establishment on the top of my list.
1	neg	train	People are a little fake and snooty...the food isn't that damn good, in fact it's a rip...lots of pretenders hanging
1	neg	train	"The food at Typhoon, I have found, is extremely hit and miss. The waiters don't offer any insight as too favorite dishes and often leave you wondering, ""What did I just order?"" As far as atmoshpere, or lack there of, is concerned...I can sum it up by saying I could never be impressed with a restaurant that has a one person bathroom with a huge vacuum that you have to hurdle over to use the facilities!!! This Typhoon is in a very trendy area and one would think that they would at least attempt to keep up with their competitors. If you are over than way and hungry, there is a Thai Orchid just down the street, head on over there!"
3	neg	train	I had the New York Steak, and it was one one of the best cuts of meat I've had for a while. The waitress was very attentive.
1	neg	train	The place was too loud and busy. Food that was ordered was not given. Had to call the waiter several times to help us, instead of him coming over to make sure everything was all right. The place was fairly clean, service was definitely a negative, and the food didn't look like the picture in the menu. The portions were very sparingly and food looked so as for as appetizing. The experience is definitely a no no to go back.
1	neg	train	Good show for the kids, but you'd be better off eating at McDonald's.
3	neg	train	The food was good (very fresh fish), yet the service left much to be desired.
2	neg	train	"While traveling on business, I thought that I would ""treat myself"" and go to a ""nice"" restaurant rather than take out or a pizza delivered to my room.---- Wrong decision tonight! I ordered Rack of Lamb- medium rare and got Rack of Road Kill- WELL done. It was so chewy, I may have developed TMJ on the 2 chops that I chose to give a try. ** Yes, I know to send a suboptimal entree back, but I was tired and just wanted to go back to the hotel. TIP--- Costco sells GREAT Rack of Lamb. Rub it with a little pesto, broil 10 mins and enjoy!!!!!"
1	neg	train	"I went to Ayoush after having been told it was good,but I was obiously miss informed, it was awfull. I arrived and was taken to my table (cave) downstairs in the ""MEMBERS ONLY CLUB"" (or so they call it) The waiters didn't come for ages and when they did, instead of taking our orders they would TRY and chat up me and my friends. we finally orderd the food having got it an hour later. it was not at all tasefull and shortly I lost my appitite. The belly dancer came(she was old enough to be my grandma, I was surprised that she could dance for more than a minute). The service was terrible for the rest of the night and by midnight we were given the bilI and told to leave. The bill came up to a ridiculous amount which I wasn""t happy about paying but did so anyway. The staff and male customers were extremly sleezy, it made me feel quite uncomfortable and most definatly in the wrong place. I shall not be visiting the place again...."
1	neg	train	It was awful. We sat there for 20 minutes until someone came to our table. We then ordered and waited another 30 min until the first item was brought. We left. Horrible, horrible service and the manager was nasty to us.
3	neg	train	Roof top bar at the Vendue Inn. Great city views. Heaters through out the are provide warmth in the winter. Soups an salads are good. Our other selections were below average. Wait staff is friendly but slow and unattentive.
1	neg	train	"On Saturday, October 9, 2004 we had dinner with another couple at Lake Lynn Lodge. They heard about the restaurant through a coupon and suggested that we dine there, my husband and I had been there before. Our server greeted our table within 5 minuets of our arrival. Our table ordered water. It was cloudy and unpleasant tasting. Due to the quality of the water we ordered other beverages. One member of our party had draft beer, which the establishment ran out of during our visit. When it was time to order the kitchen was out of the whole fish, which was what one of our dining companions wanted so he ordered a seafood platter with fries and coleslaw. Our party also ordered onion pieces as an appetizer, two ladies filets cooked medium rare and a T-bone also medium rare. They were also out of coleslaw and the server returned to tell us that she would just bring a salad. Unfortunately, the man that ordered the coleslaw does not eat salad so he asked if he could have soup or anything else in place of the coleslaw. The server returned and said that the soup was more expensive than the coleslaw so they could discount the soup $1 which was the cost of the coleslaw. He asked what else he could substitute and she said nothing. He asked if she could just discount the meal $1. The server said that she would tell the manager he said that. She never addressed what they were going to do to replace the coleslaw and nothing was done. From the time we ordered it was more that 53 minuets until our appetizer arrived. Two other tables were seated after us and had their meals before we had our appetizer. When the appetizer arrived it was only 2 or 3 minuets until our food arrived which did not give us time to enjoy the appetizer before the food would begin to get cold. The ladies filets were both significantly smaller than usual and did not have the look or texture of a fillet. Mine was 3 separate pieces of meat with bacon wrapped around it. One of the pieces had quite a bit of fat on it. It was cooked medium rare but the outside of the steak was barely warm when it arrived, the outside is usually very hot. The server did not return to ask how the food was so we just ate it. She returned to ask if we wanted dessert, which we declined. When the server left the checks our friends gave her their payment and their coupon. She had an unacceptable attitude toward the coupon. She ignored our payment and said to our friends ""Oh, you have a coupon  this will take a while"". The coupon stated that the tip should be figured based on the price of the meal before the coupon. The ""should"" in that statement means that the tip will not be included. Understandably, our friends were confused when their bill increased and they asked what the increase was for. The server informed them that the tip had been added and then made the statement ""We hate coupons"". At this point we asked if there was new management because our experience was not as pleasant usual. The server's response was that she didn't cook the food. She took my credit card and returned with the receipt. She then said that she had to take it so she wouldn't hold anyone up. I asked if she had to have it right then and she said yes. After we had waited so long on our food I couldn't believe she said that to me. I also feel that it was inappropriate to wait for me to sign the receipt. I had planned to leave the tip as cash with the receipt on the table when we left but didn't want to dig through my purse to give it to her right then so I signed the receipt and gave it to her without tip on it. She stomped away. I left a cash tip on the table but when we got to the door I heard her saying very derogatory things about me and the rest of our party so, I went back to the table and picked it up. When we walked out the door, she followed us until she thought we could not hear her and continued with derogatory rhetoric including ""Don't come back"" the rest of it I am not able to publish here. There were at least two other staff members privy to the shameful display and no one did anything to stop it. I went back in and asked for the manager. She did not apologize for anything and said that the server must be having a bad night. I also wrote a letter to the general manager that was not answered."
2	neg	train	"Went to the steakhouse at 7pm on a Saturday. The first clue that this was not-too-great a place was when we noticed the place was empty. We were seated immediately and that's where it ended. The service was beyond bad. It was non-existent. The food was okay, but for the price, it seemed high 8 dollars for a ""side salad"" was a bit much... but having it delivered late was just bad. About an hour into our dinner, a group of four came in for dinner, waited for some time, then left as nobody waited on them. BAD SERVICE!!!!!"
2	neg	train	"The only thing going for this restaurant is the location near Staples Center. Other than that, I'd much rather dine at Taylor's for half the cost, or even Morton's for twice the food. I continually got the impression from the staff at this restaurant that they were much, much better than me and that they really did not need my business. It was my first time dining there and it was my last time dining there. I went there based on the recommendation from the LA Times. The Times has also recieved a letter from me regarding their misguided review. I went with my wife and another couple. We waited for 45 minutes at the front desk even though we had reservations. Consequently, we had to rush our dinner to get to the theatre on time. The waitress ignored us, making us feel we weren't as important as the wealthy businessmen seated next to us. At one point, I got up and got my own water from a nearby water pitcher, walking right by our waitress. She didn't even care. Three of the four steaks ordered at our table had to be sent back. One medium-rare was so well-done. When my steak was returned to me, the plate was dropped on the table and juice splattered on my shirt. No staff member noticed or even cared for that matter. This restaurant is good for taking your out of town tourists friends just so they can enjoy the ""LA experience"". The Palm is the epitome of LA. Here they can see shallow, want-to-be actors who rudely and cluelessly wait on you, here today-gone tomorrow actors that think they are the messiah, and loud, drunk sport hooligans who feel it is there birthright to act like gorillas. I felt like I was on the set of the movie ""L.A. Story"", only Steve Martin wasn't there to entertain these disgruntled customers. I am no prude, I just expected more from this place."
3	neg	train	A little shop located inside a gas station. The atmosphere is pretty bad, but the food ain't. Grab something to go and enjoy!
1	neg	train	"The waitstaff was rude, especially the young lady who brought the menus and took our orders. After a very long wait, our food was served by a male who could not speak very good English and we weren't sure if we had the food we ordered. They were serving buffet that Sunday and we believe they were unhappy that we did not order the buffet. The portions served were very small and were priced in the 13.95 to 15.95 price range. I had to request a second cup of coffee which had a price tag of 1.95. Very un pleasant experience. Fortunatly we do have a good Indian restaurant in the downtown area called "" Passage to India"" that we do patronize."
2	neg	train	The worst lunch experience I've ever had! If you're open for lunch you should be prepared to serve lunch. There weren't even that many people in the restaurant at the time and we could not get waited on by anyone. Food was coming out to wrong tables and it was also coming out in double orders - each table around us got the wrong food delivered to their table twice! We couldn't even get one delivery let alone 2! Only having an hour for lunch we ended up walking out without food being brought to our table and couldn't even get it to go - it just never came. Bad, bad, bad!
3	neg	train	"Shock, surprise, perhaps a fleeting sensation of fear, quickly evolving into all out ""uncomfortable"". That is perhaps the best way to describe the reaction of staff, during the first minutes of my visit to The Egg & I restaurant. A predominantly white (no...let me say 99.999% white) community nestled just outside Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado Estes Park boasts beautiful scenery, and the said restaurant, but no diversity. Therefore, a person of color may find this locale less than ""warm"". Service was prompt and friendly... (albeit my waitress seemed rather uncomfortable to even talk to me). Offering a wide array of breakfast selections, flavored and traditional coffee, egg dishes as well as waffles and pancakes, the food was served fast and hot, and prepared fresh. My breakfast of 'asparagus & bacon frittata, home fry potatoes, english muffin and coffee, totaled up to less than $9.00. A GREAT value for breakfast, by any estimation. Overall: good food, good service; people of color... don't anticipate the welcome wagon to greet you. Bon Apetite!"
1	neg	train	The service was extemely rude. The waiter disappeared fo long periods of time. When it came time to pay the check another waiter finally delivered it after we tried to get our waiters attention for several minutes. When the substitute waiter brought the check back our waiter had added 20% tip for a party of five. When questioned, management stated that that is the policy. BE AWARE
2	neg	train	the food is pretty good, i really like their dessert, but the service is really suck. actually, i don't remember what is the name of the server..but he is an asian guy with glasses on...he seldomly come and pick up the plate and i wait for 20 minutes for my drink, they charge $23.95 for each person,therefore, i have some expectation on their service, but that really make me feel disappointed! I still recommended this restaurant to other friends, but just hope that they will not have the same server as i had!
3	neg	train	"This review of the China Garden Buffet is based on an average of the 2 times that we have dined there.Both times we had their $5.99 Sunday afternoon lunch buffet.On our first visit back in the fall of 2003 we were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the offerings on the buffet.Nearly all of the dishes were skillfully prepared and the enormous cocktail shrimp were cooked to perfection in that they were still firm and nicely chilled.On our second visit in February the food was anything but good and the cocktail shrimp,while still of a decent size,were ""mushy"" from overcooking.We may return one day based upon our first visit.If we were to go by our second vivit we would not return as the food was of poor quality."
3	neg	train	A really good place to stop for a quick bite to eat. It's basically a sandwich shop and ice cream shack, but the food is homemade and they have really great specials everyday
1	neg	train	I went for Valentine's day and was throughly disappointed. The staff was in a hurry, my steak sucked no one cared! way to go. adious
1	neg	train	The manager: Mislene, a young girl was pushy, rude, unprofessional. When we asked if we can complain they passed us back to her. Our visit was a very stressful one, we swallowed the food in 10 minutes and could not wait to leave this Hellish place. This woman should not be in a public place. She was managing and running the till. So two tasks plus politeness!Obviously too much for her to handle. Politeness and Nandos in Harrow is an Oximoron expression. don't go there, peter
1	neg	train	As a restaurant City Lights might be good however I never want to experience it after the terrible delivery service I had from them. I ordered my food which was very simple, an appetizer and an entree. I waited well over an hour and a half and my office is located only a few miles from their location. I never even got a phone call telling me where they were or if they were running late. I will never order from them again.
3	neg	train	Since moving to Vegas we are constantly dining out to find great eats. SuperMex is a small restaurant next to an Imported Mexican Furniture store on E Sunset near Pecos in Las Vegas. Our friends had a coupon for buy one entree get an entree free, so what the hey! we tagged along for the heck of it. We sat in the bar which had an enormous screen with skateboarding competition showing on it - um, not every authentic-mexi but whatever. The three screens above the bar were not one as two of the projectors were missing, and the other simply not on? We sat down and were given some really good salsa and large homemade tortilla chips. My friend and I ordered cocktails, she a margarita and I had THE BEST EVER pina colada. I swear to you I would go back just for the pina coladas. I venture to say they are the best in Vegas if not the best I have ever had and I have made my own many times this past summer. It was almost like a sweet coconut shake with a kick. OMG it was so good. You have to order your entreea by number, which is weird but makes it easy for everyone. I ordered the three enchilada plate with all beans, no rice but they brought me rice anyway and no x-tra beans. So they had to come back out with more beans. The food was okay, nothing extraordinary. I didn't like the chicken enchilada, the beef one was okay and the cheese was the best. Te beans were typical refried beans, nothing special. My b/f ordered the 2 enchilada and taco dinner and he said he didn't think it was very good at all. Our other friends ordered similar items and one friend took one bite and didn't eat again. Then again both he and my b/f are accustomed to Del Taco and Taco Bell. The service was poor but understandably so as it was late, on a Wednesday night and since we sat in the bar, the bartender had all the tables in that room, plus the patrons at his bar, plus he had to make drinks for everyone else in the restaurant. BTW the bathroom doors are cool, but if someone came out while you were walking past and hit you with it, you'd be knocked out cold. It looked like hammered and welded thick copper doors. I would go back for lunch just to have pina coladas, but I am not sure if I'd order food. Maybe salsa and chips and tons of pina coladas. If you like pina coladas I suggest having a looksee. Incidentally, SuperMex now takes the place of a restaurant, of which I cannot recall the name, that showed old black and white movies on screens all over the restaurant, the waiters wore black shirts and white ties. I think it was Italian? But no more, it's now a Mexican restaurant--with the best pina coladas in town. Did I mention I love their pina coladas? ;)
3	neg	train	Captain Woody's is a nice suprise tucked away beneath the entrance to the 278 bypass. The menu consists largely of freshly caught fish, shrimp, and oysters---- and all related basic preparations. The White Bean Shrimp Chili is a tasty and spicy alternative to the more famous red bean and beef. A great spot for a quick lunch or beer with oysters.
3	neg	train	Micro Brewery disguised as a Colorado hunting lodge. Diverse menu with sandwiches, soups, salads, meat and fish. The table had grilled salmon, reuben sandwich and grilled chicken sald. All were good.
1	neg	train	The attractive diningroom was noticbly empty on a Sat. night. Our waitress was slow and disinterested but finally took our orders. There was no attempt to accommodate special requests and when the food finally arrived there were several errors. Apparently the chef thought medium rare beef meant totally brown. The salmon smelled so bad it couldn't be eaten. The owner reluctantly came to our table with such a bad attitude that we were more than uncomfortable. Mr. Denardo was rude & nasty, suggesting that we were in the wrong for being dissatified with his food. McDonald's would have been a better choice, at least you get what you pay for.
1	neg	train	"after eating brunch, having been seated at our table all of 40 minutes, we were asked to leave to make room for someone else. We were told we had spent too much time. The waiter had returned with our credit card slip just 5 minutes before we were asked to leave. 40 minutes for 3 people to eat a brunch is not an unreasonable amount of time to spend. When confronted the manager just said ""oh well, sorry"". Unfortunatly our credit card had been run through or we would have adjusted the tip accordingly. Very POOR service. Drinks had to be reordered 3 times before they arrived. One beverage never did arrive."
1	neg	train	"This was perhaps the worst $40 I've ever spent on food and soda for my Wife and I. We went when they just opened on a weekend. Parking was no problem in the garage. I wish there was no space to park so I would have gone elsewhere. Their ""hot"" foods were warm. Tables were tiny. What's this wonderful service I keep on reading about. We sure didn't experience it when we were there. Empty soda glasses waiting to be refilled sat on on the small table along with our empty dirty dishes. It took several minutes before I could flag someone down to check out. It looks like you can't just get up and pay as you exit. Maybe I'm wrong. The tables are too close together. Kids were running around. If you can't watch your kids while you're at a restaurant, maybe it's a sign you should leave them home with a babysitter. Poor value. Warm food being passed off as hot. Fried foods were overcooked and had no flavor. The only highlight was dessert and parking. I wish I had my $40 back. Their website doesn't even let you express your dissatisfaction. The only way my Wife and I will return is if someone invited us to go with them and they were picking up the tab. Stay away!!! At least we didn't get sick from this place. Aaaaaaahhh!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3	neg	train	Nice location and atmosphere. Wine list is some what limiting because of charging a premium for glasses. The menus contain several beef and seafood options. Even of a weekday night with about 30% of the tables ocupied we were rushed through our meal. Entrees came before we were half way through our salads. Waiter only returned once more. That was to bring the check.
2	neg	train	The restaurant is very nice. The food, however, is lacking. I ordered the Prime Aged New York Strip cooked Medium Well - $30. My husband ordered the Rib Eye $25. When my steak came out, it was Medium and burnt. I sent it back to the kitchen to have it cooked more. When it returned, it was charred beyond belief - burnt on the outside and just a little below Medium Well on the inside. Our waiter never once came back to see if the steak was good. My husbands steak was also charred on the outside but his was cooked properly on the inside. We were very upset that after paying that much for a steak, it was horrible. The one thing that I can say positive about the meal is that the hash browns were very good. I liked the atmosphere but will not return to eat there.
3	neg	train	Part of the Landrys Seafood Chain. Always a good bet if you are traveling and unsure of the local area. Seafood entrees highlight the menu. Several preperations are offered. Salad comes in a lrge bowl for the entire table. Gumbo is quite good. Servicce could be enhanced a touch.
3	neg	train	Tourist favorite in the heat of the Market district. Waits can be over an hour. Fish selections are posted on large boards. You are able to choose your fish and your preperation. If you don't mind the wait, even at lunch, this is sure to please.
3	neg	train	Well - the meat was of good quality, but the cooking itself lacked taste. I mean, nothing that we will really remember. The rack of lamb was small.
1	neg	train	Just plain lousy.
2	neg	train	Overall the night was a success. I enjoyed my tapas but my boyfriend did not enjoy his at all. I tried the mussels with sausage. I thought they were good. My boyfriend had the beef wellington and thought it was dry and over cooked. We would have rated higher except my boyfriend was convinced he kept seeing mice running around on the floor. He WAS right. Not exactly appetizing when you see that!! Service was alright. Tight quarters made it awkward for my boyfriend as he is a bigger guy. I'd go back with a girlfriend but not with my boyfriend.
3	neg	train	Best food in central Minn. Executive chef Kevin Aho is one of the most creative chefs out there. Any reastraunt that has a chef that talented should be very proud. I give chef Kevin 5 stars he is fabulous.
3	neg	train	eh...not a bad place. Limited menu as far as real food. Hot dogs and sloppy joes are about it. The place does most of it's business with ice cream.
1	neg	train	I agree.... their theme seems to be 'overcharge and give really poor service to those vegans who have little choice to go elsewhere'. Stay home, make yourself a good tofu stirfry instead and save yourself some grief. Truly, sad service.
2	neg	train	This placed sucked. It looks very attractive because there is a big dragon head on the outside of the building and you walk through its mouth to enter, but it is not at all a pleasant dining experience. The food was cold, took forever to come out, and just plain sucked.....it may be a great place for the kids, but other than that its terrible.
1	neg	train	"I had driven past this restaurant on several occasions. Each time the parking lot was full, and people were waiting to be seated. What was I missing? Absolutely nothing! Upon arriving I felt like I was in a cheesy Las Vegas restaurant. The hostess was rude, and the waitress very un-attentive. To make the experience worse- the food was , in my opinion, NOT THE BEST!!! Out of the four people seated at my table, not one person thought their meal was ""enjoyable"". I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is light on cash, or in the mood for a good meal."
3	neg	train	A converted house in the Mid town neighborhood of Atlanta. The prices on the wine list are more towards the $30 range than the $20 range. An eclectic range of preperations for both appitizzers and entrees. Meat, seafood, and salads are available. Reservations are strongly recomended. Valet parking is available on weekends.
1	neg	train	Terrible experience. The waiter did not inform us that there was no pita bread for the hummus - simply brought us the hummus platter without bread - how was I supposed to eat this - with my fingers? There were 4 of us, we ordered drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees, and dessert. We found we were overcharged for the entrees because we shared. The waiter did not explain that there would be an extra charge, and the menu did not state it anywhere either. Further, the manager was rude - she informed me that I could take my business elsewhere. I will. And I will never go back to La Fenice again.
1	neg	train	"We have eaten here before, so we knew that the food is very good. So, we went one evening during the week (the first week in December). It was about 9:30 at night, there was a band playing and there were a lot of people in the bar area, presumably for a holiday party. We were seated right away, which was a plus; however, NO ONE came to our table after that. We watched other parties arrive and be served - including tables surrounding ours - despite that fact that we had been seated before these other people! I tried to get anyone's attention, but the loud music drowned out my attempts, and the staff never looked ""up"" - they always had a distant 'look'. When we got up to leave, approximately 15 minutes later, a waitress came over and asked if there was a problem, my husband said, ""Well, no one wants to serve us so we're leaving."" She replied, ""Cool"" and shrugged her shoulders as we left. We travel extensively, and I have never had such an unpleasant experience!"
2	neg	train	"This was one of the most bland Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten. I was lured here by the advertisement of ""organic"" and ""no lard"". When my partner and I arrived, we were interested by the appearance of the place. It's a pretty restaurant. We were eventually led to our seating - the big main room is loud and echos, like a cafeteria. Casual conversation is difficult due to the sheer noise of the place. The waitress was very helpful and friendly, but that could not offset the food. The salsas for the chips tasted like they came out of jars, and not a good brand. They were extremely mild and not a bit of spice to them. I looked around for some hot sauce and noticed that there was no salt, pepper, or hot sauce at all on any of the tables. Our food when it arrived was pretty, but incredibly dull. No flavor, very little spices, cheap ingrediants. The flan for dessert was blah and covered with butterscotch (not a carmelized sugar as it's supposed to) and sided with canned whip cream. (for $4.50 a desert, you would think they would take the 5 minutes to make a big batch of real whipped cream..it's not that hard) I looked around during dinner and then noticed something very strange - all of the people eating and all of the waitresses/waiters, were white (including myself and my partner). The only Mexican/Hispanic people in the place were doing the table cleaning. I finally figured out that to get decent food, I'd have to find where the Mexican groups ate. Tia Rosa seems to be just a factory to pump out bland/cheap food at high prices to the majority of tourists and old biddies who don't know that Mexican food is supposed to taste better than this. Not worth the $30 for dinner- I'm going back to the hole in the wall place down the street that has food that tastes 10x better for 1/4 the price."
2	neg	train	"I would say that anyone might want to go once...the Rainforest ""theme"" is fun the first time (stupidly, this was not our first time). After arriving at 7pm, we were STILL waiting to be seated at 9:30pm and didn't see a crumb of food until almost 10:30pm. Overpriced, mediocre-tasting food and the longest wait ever for the privilege of it all. The ""theme"" wasn't enough to get me to overlook everything else."
3	neg	train	I have been to this restaurant a number of times, but don't know if I'll return. They used to have great music you can eat to, but now they have this loud stuff and instead of being able to talk, I can't hear myself think! What happened to the other guy with the great guitar??
3	neg	train	Just Plain Good Buffet Food. Reasonably Priced. Little Bit Noisy. Fresh Baked Bread about Every 15 Minutes. Good Selection of Baked Goods.
1	neg	train	"We had reservations for two people on February 14, 2003, at 7:00 PM. We arrived to find the lobby area or ""bar"" as they choose to call it totally full of people. I was finally able to check in and let them know we were there. We sat at a table in this lobby area and watched numerous couples/groups be seated. The owner (Elaine) came over to our table and initiated service. I told her that the table was not acceptable due to the crowded area around us, but that we were in no hurry and would wait for a table in the main restaurant area. She said no problem. We moved from this small table to a two seat bar area, directly in front of the hostess/cash register/wine storage area...and then sat there for almost 1.5 hours. At about 9:30 PM, two other couples who had been waiting in this same area were seated (in the main restaurant area, not the lobby/bar) who had 8 or 9 PM reservations. When I asked the owner (Elaine) what had happened to us being seated, she said...""you gave up your table."" We about fell over backward at that comment. We had purchased a bottle of wine, made no complaints and were actually just relaxing...there was no reason for this type of treatment. There was one other couple seated at one of these three lobby/bar tables and they also expressed the fact they did not like the table because of all the noise and the fact the waitress never came by to serve them. They were told it was just too bad. In fact, when they were initially seated, ""Elaine"" whispered to us...""Fooled them didn't I?"" When they said they were leaving, they were told their credit card would be charged the $70 for the reservation. When I heard this, I immediately requested my credit card be credited with the $70, paid for the wine and made it very clear how unhappy we were at being treated the way we were. I guess I could understand their feelings had we made a scene or complained, but we were very compliant with the wait. It is very obvious they had overbooked, and had only two waitresses to serve 17-21 tables. When we left, no one had been seated at the three tables in this lobby/bar area or for that matter even offered to be seated there. I have been to this restaurant many times in the past and was very disappointed in how the owners treated us."
3	neg	train	The one thing I notice there were too many cameras watching at one table. This is not a bank or a casino type. They better get rid of it.
1	neg	train	"This is one of the most overhyped restaurants in the city. Overall, the theme seems to be ""quantity over quality"", as the food menu is book-like and only reflects a lack of focus or skill in any one particular cuisine. Similarly, the portions are outrageously large, but bland and on the greasy/cheesy side. It wasn't so good that I was clamoring to take the rest home. I have no idea why the wait is so long, but I think it's totally unwarranted. Spend your time and money elsewhere (there are plenty of great restaunts in the area) and pick up a cheesecake for dessert on your way home."
2	neg	train	We went to Glowbal on a reccomendation from some people from work. When we arrived, we waited a few minutes to be seated and then more that another for our waitress to arrive. We attempted to order wine, three of which they were out of so continues with just a few cocktails. We tried the satays which were written up in one of the local papers and were surprised by the lack of content on the plate. We also tried the carpaccio which was a much better value. The entrees were average with not much on the plates to match the descriptions that were on the menu. My salmon was med. well instead of the med. rare that I would have perferred. My husbands Pork chop was good though as was the Tuna. The creme brulee was very good but our overall experience was soured by the lack of personality from our waitress. She was a little to stuffy for the room and seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out. Well it worked as we did not order anything else. Glowbal has a great room but needs to work on the rest to do their reputation justice.
3	neg	train	I don't know who was to blame, the waitress or the bartender, the drinks took forever while the food orders were very prompt. We shared a double order of the satay which was tasty but overpriced. The entrees were great, the mojitos disgusting, & the atmosphere a little lacking. We could not see the open kitchen nor the bar, just plain wood walls from where we were sat. I'd have to say that my wife and I won't be in a hurry to make it back to Glowbal
1	neg	train	We made reservations since we were recomended to by the hostess I spoke over the phone. We got to the restaurant all excited, I stepped to the hostess to give her my name and she ignored me. Mind you no one was there (customers), then she finally looked at me and said what was that? I was like okay , dinner will be better. We did not get any sevice for 30 min., then after we ordered we did not get our food for another hour. We were all joking around asking each other what are they doing cooking our food? Each course took a hour long to come out. Our waiter did not even come out to check on us, no refills on drinks, no customer service and no personality. I asked for the manager, and our waiter said that he was off that day. I hope no one goes to this restaurant.
1	neg	train	The worst tasteless, overpriced food ever. No flavor, no color. The food was cold, fries were hot, but they were also white. Veggies were the worst canned veggies I've had. NO-Refills on the sodas, thats just B.S. I couldn't wash down that crappy food. I paid $21 for a salmon lunch.
2	neg	train	I had a very shocking and surprising experience. The customer service is not at all good. So, we decided not to give any tips. At the end, they demanded tips and we told the reasons why we are not giving. So, the guy asked us not to come again. What kind of Restaurant is this ? This is my first ever experience in my life. I hope this may be last experience also.
2	neg	train	"The waiter we had seemed to be having a really bad night. He acted as though we were inconviencing him. The food was ok but not worth the price. This restaurant was formerly known as ""Charlie Browns."" It has really gone down hill in recent years."
3	neg	train	A quite family run restuarant in downtown Ashkum. The chicken is actually really, really good. The Italian is homemade and a family restuarant, so it's a different taste, but a good one.
1	neg	train	The food gave me salmonella, made me so sick, service was ok
1	neg	train	We were seated in an aisle and were repeatedly bumped into. The silverware had food on them and had to be replaced. My Filet Mignon was fatty and the vegatables were served cool to warm. The value was not up the the standard it should be considering the pricing. A very disappointing experience.
1	neg	train	The waiter was awful. I had to go to the front to get our drinks refilled. My food came out burnt on the edges. My husband wanted to have his food put in a to go container when we were going to leave and the waitress put his plate in the dirty plate bin. I let her know that he was upset because he wanted to take it home and she actually pulled it out of the bin and was going to bag it. Yuk!
1	neg	train	Was a horrible experience,. It was a Saturday night and the waitress (blonde hair tied back) was unprofessional and should be fired! She was very flirty with several of the men at our table and we were ALL very upset with this. None of us felt comfortable there at all and will NEVER return.
2	neg	train	Served A hamburger, called a French Burger, ordered not bloody. and the meat was really badly burnt all the way and had a funny taste other than Burned. was meat like the packaged cheap stuff, not fresh at all. Was asked If I needed a doggie bag. Dog food would have been better. Did take off check but lost appetite and ruined my luncheon date.
2	neg	train	"I took my wife and three children, ages 7, 5, and 3 to lunch on a Sunday. The bill was $63 including tip. I had pasta which was $13 my wife had ribs $16 and $1.20 for a side salad. Now my complaint is to charge me $4.99 for a freakin grill cheese sandwhich and then charge me another $1.50 for a glass of pop. $6.50 per kid!!!! Not exactly a ""family restaurant"". Food was good though and the service was good."
2	neg	train	The service was not prompt, but the waitress was pleasant enough. Some of the food tasted like it was warmed over from the day before.
2	neg	train	"Cafe inside a truckstop. They have American and Tex-Mex food on the menu. We stopped there around 9:15 one night and the waitress didn't want to serve us, said they were getting ready to close (posted closing time is 10:00 pm). My husband begged her into taking an order for cold deli sandwiches since the cook refused to make anything else. Food was just plain awful: stale bread, brown lettuce and green tomatoes on sandwiches. Had to settle for potato chips instead of fries because the cook said he'd ""already cleaned the fryer and wasn't going to mess it up for one lousy order"". Aren't truckstop places supposed to be open all the time? Aren't they supposed to serve big satisfying meals? I kind of doubt many truckers would eat at this place!"
3	neg	train	Lia's is an extremely small pizzeria located in a very busy shopping center.They only have a half dozen or so small tables and are primarily set up for take-out orders.Just be careful while entering and exiting your parking space and while walking to and from the restaurant since people drive(and park!) like fools here!As far as their food is concerned,we sampled three different pizzas.We had their plain cheese,which we found to be pretty good.We tried their sausage which we found to be even better than the cheese,although it was a bit greasier than it needed to be.The final pie that we sampled was their mushroom,meatball and onion.This pizza we found to be very disappointing!The meatballs were strangely shaped and seemed more like oblong chunks of meatloaf.They were also very skimpy on the onions and mushrooms.The biggest fault with this final pizza however, was that the cheese on it was about a half an inch thick.I shudder to think what it would have been like if we had ordered extra cheese!
2	neg	train	Today, around 6:00 P.M. me and my wife went there to celebrate our anniversary, in your location in Olive Branch Ms. Since we came, I noticed that the service was unacceptable we were ignored, all the waiters were not busy or just standing around. The point is you should be made to feel as you are and important person. Thank you P.S. I told the same to the manager and he was very sarcastic Juan Carlos Nava
2	neg	train	Most expensive meal that I did not enjoy at all.
2	neg	train	We have eaten at Don Pablo's many times since it opened. At first, the service and food were wonderful. But, through the years it has gotten awful. The quality of the service is not the same and the quality of the food has decreased dramatically. Our last 3 experiences left us looking for another favorite restaurant. I would no longer recommend it to anyone.
2	neg	train	The atmosphere was nice, service was very good. The big problem was the extremely small portions of both appetizers and entrees. It is for this reason that I would not return. There are too many restaurants in San Francisco to put up with something like that.
3	neg	train	Great food, great service very hard to get reservations a floors need to be clean at least once a day & bathrooms are so filthy, I guage the cleanliness of your kitchen based on just how clean your restrooms are.
1	neg	train	Service was extremely rude and virtually non-existant, it took us half and hour to order our appetizers and wine (at a time when there were only 4 tables in the restaurant. After the appetizers arrived we didn't see anyone until I got up and spoke with the manager to get our check. I've had bad service but this was inexcusable!
2	neg	train	"Though my salmon hotpot was tasty but rather bland, it did not have any really ""gosh, that was yummy!"". But my wife and neighbour ordered shripm curry. After everyone had been served they were offered chicken, but were actually served shrimp! My wife had three shrimps, after a search, with the waitress. But she brought another bowl with five shrimps later The curry itself was not at all tasty, too much flour, and bland - more like a floury gravy. Though the Staff did reduce my wife's and my bill by fifteen percent."
2	neg	train	After reading all the glowing reviews, I couldn't wait to try this landmark of the Sunset! Well, after my experience, I decided it's perfect for those who don't like sushi, meaning raw fish. Every roll was drenched in mayonnaise,and my order of Amaebi was shrimp previously frozen...I also had the annoying feeling of waitstaff hovering over me to leave after 20 minutes.
1	neg	train	I would never recommend this place to anyone. We had 14 people for a wedding rehearsal dinner. We were seated at three different tables. Steak dinners had to be sent back, sometimes twice, to be cooked. Service was poor and the owner was very condescending when told of the problems with the dinner. Will never dine there again and will not ever recommend this place!
3	neg	train	"Basic seafood spot in the exterior section of SouthPoint Mall. Make a reservation if you wish to dine at 7 pm or later. Menu consists of mostly fried food and ""baskets/platters"". There are 2-3 fish specials each night. The seabass with sun dried tomatoes was very good!"
1	neg	train	You have to stand in line sometimes 30+ minutes. It is entirely buffet, the steak is mostly fat, the vegetables are not ripe, the chicken is half cooked. The service is appalling. If you get something to drink, don't expect to have any refills unless you can get them yourself. The only good thing is the bakery. They have a large selection and everything is cooked.
1	neg	train	I went there tonight and waited 1.25 hours for a starter, the staff were rude and lazy and one particular member seemed more interested in lighting the water pipe (don't know its name) and smoking it. When the food arrived it was average and I finally finished my main course 1.75 hours after ordering. Shambolic and very unprofessional. Had I not been there with a group of people, I would have been happy to have walked out without paying.... Worst restaurant I have ever been to. http://www.ayoush.com
1	neg	train	Molto bene! We've eaten at Italian restaurants up and down the coast (we're from Seattle) and it doesn't get any better than Zagarella's. Fancier perhaps, and more expensive, but not better. Distinct sauces for each dish, fresh ingredients, and where else do you get home made marinated olives as an appetizer, and sauteed escargot antipasto? If you love good Italian, this is one you have to try.
3	neg	train	Excellent service and a neat atmosphere, but I really didn't feel the food was worth the price. Really pricey. It's kind of a trendy place.
3	neg	train	A quick severice Mexican resturant. The menu offers burittos, taco and bowls. Meats, vegatables, and toppings can be choosen. All are of good quality. Great place for a quick lunch.
3	neg	train	Food was adequate. Appitizer recommendation provided by waiter did not follow dietary needs provided by patron prior to ordering. (told of vegitarian needs, waiter recommended Eggplant (stuffed with veal)). OVERPRICED for what is provided. VERY Noisy, condidering not extremely crowded.
1	neg	train	Nice atmosphere to bad the food and service was not the same.
1	neg	train	The atmosphere is fine and the service was okay, but the food is a disgrace. We ordered the buffet because the menu was nonsensical and the staff didn't seem too knowledgeable about the items. While the wine and drink menus are nicely printed and laminated, the dinner menu is printed on a green piece of copy paper and lists one item after the other with no description. The buffet appeared to be the way to go. Unfortunately, that was a mistake. Obviously a seafood connoissuer is not preparing the menu items. The majority of the food is overly seasoned, especially with salt and pork fat. Most of the seafood items are fried. The only baked seafood items were teriyaki salmon and soft shelled stuffed crab. Why are there so many chicken and beef items on the buffet? Seafood lovers aren't interested and those who don't like seafood aren't going to dine at Goosby's. Six buffet bars and only two had seafood;one salad/raw bar(hello health department);one dessert;two were side items such as pintos and cabbage. I soon began to wish I had ordered from the menu, but as I looked around the room I realized no one else was satisfied. One lady's salad was delivered to he three times before it was correct and her spouse was not at all happy when his meal arrived in a quart size chinese-style container. He obviously believed it was going to be an entre. The dessert bar is akin to all those chinese buffet dessert bars. You know,canned fruit, flavorless cake squares and cobbler wanna-be! Management should also be made aware that Melamine dinnerware does not go with upscale cloth dinner napkins and wine glasses. Choose one or the other;combining both is tacky! Our pathetic excuse for a meal cost us almost $47.00. $19.95 per person for buffet(we don't even eat crab legs)and $1.95 per for tea. After leaving the waiter his tip(the bad food isn't his fault and service was good) almost $55.00. What a waste! Don't look for this place to stick around! Take your appetite and your money somewhere that really knows something about seafood!
1	neg	train	"I attended a graduation party at the Salt Lick off 360 where we had a party of about 37 people. When we got there, no one told us about any different eating options, they just brought food out and set it on the table. So, we ate, and after the meal, we were informed that our meals would be $29.00 per person. I had eaten 4 pieces of sausage, two pork ribs and some potatoes!! Also, the manager would not allow us to each pay separately, so we all had to figure out the money and get people change that needed it by ourselves. When one person told the manager that she did not eat anything and the waitress that had taken her plate and everyone else around her told her the same thing, the manager said that that wasn't her problem. Apparently, the bill was calculated by assiging each person with an ""all you can eat plate"", which none of the people present were aware, and then adding tax and gratuity to that. The barbecue wasn't even that good, compared to other places such as Rudy's, and they don't even refill your water glass for you. They just set big pitchers of water on the table and you refill your own glass. I thought the overall experience was extremely unpleasant and I will never go back."
1	neg	train	My family and I visited this location in April of 2004. When my wife recieved her steak she noticed a bad odor. The meat was spoiled. My steak and my sons were fine. When I told the waitress she took it to the back and said it was bad and applogized. My son and I finished our dinner before a replacement meal was brought back. I asked the waitress to have the manager bring her meal out. He appologized. Thats all he did. I told the waitress that he should not have charged us for my wifes meal. He had it taken off the ticket. I have managed restuaraunts in the past. If you serve a customer spoiled food (which can make them sick) you owe them more than an appology. You owe them dinner (and maybe a coupon for the next visit). I had to ask him to comp just her meal. A steak place that has spoiled meat will have other major issues (since this is what they serve daily). I understand that these things can happen in any food establishment, but what can be said of the managment? I highly reccommend not eating in this location. The manager is not watching his food quality or taking care of his guests.
1	neg	train	"I have never paid $60.00 to cook my own food in a pot of oil/broth. For the $$ I could have enjoyed a great meal at a fine restaurant. Instead I found myself fishing in a pot of mucky oil looking for a scrap of food to eat. As for the dessert, the ""morsels"" of cake and fruit were just so-so. The small amount of chocolate they provided for you to dip your dessert bits in was not enough to provide a satifactory dipping experience. No satifaction with anything on the plate. Our bill for 8 people was $420.00. We had no wine or alcohol....we are just awestruck now as we all felt totally taken advantage of. If you are looking for a fine dining experience, keep looking. If you feel the need to throw away good money, this is the place."
1	neg	train	Food lacking in quality, Overrated, overpriced - a Caesar salad at $5.95 was more than half rusty lettuce, dressing & croutons ok. Not a nice experience.
1	neg	train	I'm not sure how they manage to keep any customers at all. Service was awful and when I asked to talk to a manager it turned out that the owner is here, and the waiter is his son. So I was suggested to shut up or go somewhere else. Unbelievable!
3	neg	train	If you happen to be near this place, you really don't have many options as far as places to eat. It's kind of a mix between Italian and Chicago style. Pizza's not great, but the sandwhiches are pretty good. Not worth going out of the way, but it's not bad if your there.
3	neg	train	This place is strictly carry-out. They have a huge variety of food. The portions are great for the price. Usually I can't eat a meal for $5 and not leave hungry, but here I could. Located in a bad part of town, but if you venture down this way, definately worth stopping.
1	neg	train	Came in expecting a British style pub because of the mane but no pub food on menu at all can't even get fish and chips. They don't seem interested in selling food at all a 14 year old takes a break from playing video games to make your food what food there is in over-priced and small tiny portion also loud people hanging around when in this are its best to go to sully's for large portions and low prices
3	neg	train	Not a bad place...pretty easy to miss unless you know it's there. The food is alright...nothing brag about, but it's in a neighborhood where there aren't any other choices.
1	neg	train	I have eaten at Olive's many times and have seen the quality of the food drop quite a bit. It's really frustrating, because it used to be pretty good, but now everything arrived quite overcooked and bland. Someone has forgotten how to season in the kitchen, or simply doesn't think Vermonters have any sense of taste. Their foccacia used to be the best bread around, but the last couple of times I went it has obviously been toasted, and over-toasted. The wine, which came from a bottle more or less untampered with by the kitchen, was the best part of my meal, but I don't plan on giving them another chance; I've wasted enough money there.
2	neg	train	"Reservations are not offered on Friday or Saturday night. We were there early, and were told the non-smoking section was ""closed"". They seated us next to the bar. The steak, although tender, had a funny taste. The crab cakes (the main reason to go there) were just ok. The lemon slice in the water was dried out, and the silverware had greasy fingerprints on it. The veggies were cooked to a pulp. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
3	neg	train	Not a place to go for dinner. This is the type of place you go for live music (reaggae, punk, ska etc....) and they have a really good sound system. 4 or 5 big screens and probably a dozen smaller tv's makes it a great place to go to watch football and other sports. The friday & saturday night sceen is packed full of 21 to 35 year olds and lots of hot women. Great place in my book!!!! Hence why I'm there twice a week!
3	neg	train	our food was mostly good-I don't recommend the roast pork-overcooked! watch out for when they substitute your wine! dont be fooled by the hostess/cashiers smile-she has a really rude condescending side to her! she is why we wont be returning-we used to spend alot of $$$ there! she has chased us away!!
2	neg	train	Typical chain restaurant. Fairly bland and safe food. I'm sure all of your neighbors will say that it's great, but that's because they hang out at the Outback Steakhouse.
2	neg	train	My wife and another couple traveled to the mountains from Charlotte for a weekend. The hotel desk manager recommended twigs as a nice romantic place for diiner, YEA RIGHT! It was like a bar with white table clothes. We could not here ourselves talk over the band playing. I took us 15 minutes just to get our drinks and another 45 for the food.
1	neg	train	"We were sad to learn that the Coach and Four, the prior establishment at this location, had closed its doors. It was our favorite restaurant, reserved for special occasions such as our anniversary. We did not even realize that it was now Cugino's until we sat down and looked at the menus. It appeared to be a well-rounded menu, so we ordered anticipating a similarly fine experience and the beginning of a new tradition for us. Alas, this was not to be. The real oak and cherry fires that once glowed warmly in the main room's hearths were replaced with electric simulations, despite the raw and rainy fall day. The restrooms, although freshly painted, still managed to be rather unclean. With no cold running water, we returned to our table with scalded, soapy hands. The service was good, very attentive, although it was early and we were the only ones there. The first noticeable difference between the former and current proprietors was the bread. Instead of coming straight from the oven to the table as it used to, it came reheated, warm on top and cold on the bottom, and surprisingly stale by any restaurant or supermarket standard. The salad was no better. Slightly brown iceberg leaves, fully submerged in an Italian dressing cream to disguise their age, were unimpressive. The steak, which was always the ultimate delight at Coach, was a strange and disappointing experience in the hands of Cugino's kitchen staff. Sleeping atop a variety of dated, overly cooked produce, and topped with leathery cheese, asparagus, and a yellow sauce I could not place, the fillet mignons arrived not much beyond rare as opposed to the medium that was requested. My wife and I frowned at each other, realizing we would probably never sit in ""our"" dining room again. We were left with little choice but to have the beef crated in Styrofoam and carried out. This was followed by a good rinsing off in the sink at home prior to leaving its digestion to our dogs, while we stood there in our kitchen relieving our hunger on what was left of last night's pizza."
3	neg	train	Good food and a good atmosphere. Definately go for the pizza here. Sandwhiches are pretty good also. Gotta love stuff cooked on the grill
3	neg	train	"On the same side of the street as a Thai place, a noodle house and a piercing joint; across from a pizza joint, and art space and a gas station, you may find yourself saying ""yep, I'm on 16th street"". But once you enter this little Italian place, you can forget it's actual location and pretend you're someplace in Milan or Rome instead. This is a great place to splurge on some great wine or Italian liquor. The wine list is extensive and prices range from reasonable to ""wow"". Come for the wine, but stay for the food. The food is usually fairly simple, but well prepared and full of flavor. The risotto was lovely, and was a large enough portion that I was able to enjoy it again the next day for lunch. Share some appetizers with friends, enjoy a good bottle of wine, and for just a few moments, forget about the guy selling Street Sheets on the corner."
1	neg	train	We (my fiance and I) were very excited upon arrival due to the many good reviews we had heard before coming. We were promptly seated in the basement, as the restaurant was very busy. We later learned that this was the Chinese New Year - apparently it fell on a Wednesday night for 2004. We waited approximately 10 minutes before a waiter arrived at the table. When the waiter arrived we ordered 2 mixed drinks and 2 waters. About 30 minutes later the waiter came back to take our order for the food, but during our wait and my stares at the waiter, we saw the wait staff place a soup pot at the wrong table. The people at this table began eating from the large soup pot, and then the mistake was discovered; so what happens next; the waiter takes the pot of soup to the correct table (a bunch of college kids); while I would have refused to eat the soup, these starved college kids who had also registered numerous complaints began to eat the soup. 20 minutes after we initially ordered, 2 of our dishes arrived. Pot stickers and General Tao's Chicken. We still had not received our drinks or our water. By this time I was headed up to speak to the manager, and ask him about our drinks. He assured me that they would be right to the table now that he was aware of the situation. I headed back downstairs to my table. 15 minutes later our third and final dish arrived. Szechwan Chicken, which was breaded and deep-fried so much it, resembled something similar to a pork rind. The dish was also drowned in dry chilies. My fiance could not eat the food at all, and I (fearing impending dental work) sent the crispy critters back. We still had not received our drinks or our water. This time I complained to a different waiter about the drink situation and within 10 minutes the Manager brought down our drinks, which were mediocre at best. The manager eventually took the Szechwan Chicken and drinks off of our bill, but the damage was already done. To summarize: The service is terrible: The food is worse than many Chinese buffets. The atmosphere might be all right if they do not send you to the basement. I would never go or recommend this restaurant to anyone.
1	neg	train	The Tandoori chicken at this place was very good when they opened some years ago. The last three visits it was dry, poorly cooked and only semi marinated. The califlower and potato curry was mainly large chuncks of potato. The bill was outrageous for the quality of food served.
3	neg	train	I guess this place is a chain, but they have some pretty good grilled subs. This is one of those shops in the food court at the mall (this mall being the Shoppes at Grand Prairie), so that drags down the whole atmosphere part of it. The price....WOW! $10 for a sandwhich and fries.....seems a little expensive to me, but the food was really good.
2	neg	train	"If you like steak, this place is truly worth a visit; just don't go for the added extras. The salad looked like something you'd be served in Denny's or Sizzler- beetroot straight from the can (as were the chickpeas), unripe tomatoes, lettuce that was cut hours ago, and packet parmesan. For the price (and to complement the great steak), more effort on the salad is mandatory. Don't complain about the salad either; the waiter won't tell anyone, but will advise you ""it's just salad"". Given that their speciality is steak, I wonder if they'd say ""It's just steak""?"
3	neg	train	Food: Appetizer of curried crabcakes was mostly noncrab filling of breadcrumbs but with a delicious sauce, The Caesar salad was overdressed but prepared mostly with the tender hearts of romaine lettuce. My entree of beef tenderloin with asparagus and specially ordered haricot vert (being on Atkins I wanted to skip the potato) was delicious. My dining companion's lamb dish was also deliciously tender and well seasoned. I cheated by tasting the orange creme brulee which was perfectly prepared. Fried wontons are overused...appeared in both the Caesar salad and the entree. The coffee was also delicious. The restaurant is beautiful and well designed. The service was very attentive without being intrusive.
3	neg	train	"1. French restaurant; great fun talking to ""George"" (owner); excellent wine and service. Recommend sea scallops. Review submitted by: KM Helton 2. This was a repeat visit for a couple of us. Expensive for a family - ($20-28 average for the main meal; salads additional up to $7-8 each) and the food is just ""o.k."" It's nice to have occasion to use a bit of the French language with the owner (George). Even tho' they travel to France every year, we all think George needs to visit Disney's Epcot Center French restaurant to pick up some new menu ideas. We recently visited Disney's French restaurant and the food was excellent there, as well as reasonably priced. The cheese plate here was nice. Salad with brie is very good, also, but again, very pricey since salads aren't included with the meal and are an expensive addition to an already expensive meal. One of our party had a steak with the red sauce on one visit and didn't care for the sauce at all, nor for a dish that was kind of no more than a beef stew. The scallop dish we had previously here was good, but when we returned, the menu had changed and it was removed. ! Surprising, since it seemed to be the best dish on the entire menu. Don's Pomeroy in Cleveland also makes a better creme brulee. George -we like you, but if you're reading this, take notes and improve your menu! Review submitted by: Janet P.K."
2	neg	train	After eating at this restaurant a couple times, it seems that the food and service combination will never get better. Friends have eaten here and enjoyed it, but I will never attempt it again. I had prime rib and it was cold and really fatty. The baked potato was not done completely and the service was slow on requests. They did redo the prime rib and it came back even worse. If you eat here I recommend just getting the salad bar, which is good!
2	neg	train	"The Evergreen is a Chinese buffet that offers a $5.99 lunch buffet on weekdays.While this might sound like a good deal,we must warn you that this restaurant has problems with both their food and their service.As far as the food is concerned,pretty much everything was extremely greasy and lacking in any redeeming values such as flavor or quality of ingredients.The General's chicken had potential,but their burning of the sauteed chicken ruined the flavor of it's fairly good sauce.The shrimp in hot spicy sauce should have more truthfully been called ""shrimp ala Heinz ketchup"".The fried noodles were stale and rancid.Sadly,the best tasting item was the pre-packaged fortune cookie. As far as the service was concerned,the waitress was very attentive.Unfortunately she was not very professional.She offered to get me more water and took my glass.She then went on to the next table and asked the customer there if he also wanted more water.As she took his glass I became concerned about how she was going to know which glass was mine!I was VERY relieved when she dropped both glasses on the floor and brought everyone a new one! At one point when she was taking some used plates from our table the waitress actually placed a stack of dirty dishes piled high with mussel shells on our table over my silverware!She definitely needs some training! The restaurant was neat and clean,but their seats were too short for their tables.My face was way too close to the table,and I am 6 feet tall.A shorter person would be in real trouble!"
1	neg	train	Pretties view of Destin Harbor. If you are only going for drinks. Shrimp Creole used frozen mini salad shrimp. Not acceptable in a town known for its fresh seafood.
3	neg	train	Ok here is my only complaint, I was raised on Philadelphia Cheesesteak's so I think that makes me kinda like a Philly cheesesteak expert, there are so many restaurants who claim to have the Philadelphia Cheese Steak and some do. Max's opera Cafe is not one of them...For the record, you do not use mozzarella cheese on a philadelphia cheese steak! You also should use Amoroso brand rolls not French rolls. Now I know your restaurant says on the door, critics not welcome but who reads signs. Over all you have an excellent restaurant although I still can't understand why you have the letter V on all your chairs when you restaurant is named Max's Opera cafe. If you plan to try out Max's the food and the service is great just don't be fooled by the cheesesteak ... that is NOT a Philly Cheese Steak.
1	neg	train	This is a bad apple in an otherwise great chain. I have been treated rudely in the past at this location, and recently was treated in a very unprofessional manner by the restaurant's general manager. The food is okay and the recently remodeled restaurant is beautiful. However the employees seem to suffer from a lack of morale and what seems to be absenteeism on the part of management. There seems to be a high turnover of employees, but it seems that none of them are shown how to be polite to customers. There is a lack of common courtesy and respect towards the customer. When I told the manager that I had been unhappy with his restaurant on several occasions, he didn't apologize but offered excuses. He had the attitude that I wanted something for free and that customer feedback to management was not welcome. It seemed our conversation was more of a headache and annoyance than anything else.
3	neg	train	"The view was the best thing here. The seafood was about average, at most. I had broiled scallops (which were a bit overdone) and my wife had crab cakes. She has tried these at many restaurants and this one was not impressive at all to her. Each entree came with a potato of choice and a salad bar visit. The prices were high for the caliber of food here. I am guessing this is due to it being one of just a few restaurants on the ""main drag"" into town."
1	neg	train	-Rude Host -Rude Waitress -45 minute wait for food -Cold soup -Dry/Hard bread on sandwich -No refill on water -Waitress forgot 3 things we asked for -Overcharged -Absolutely horrible vacation experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3	neg	train	Wonderful choppped salad, love the filet and creamed spinach. Best sour apple martini as well. We had a wonderful experience!
2	neg	train	Food is great but we've had several bad experiences with the waiters. We even had the manager chew us out when we tried to return an appetizer that the waitress had gotten wrong. We had told them we would spend extra money to add something to the dish and when we got it, it had not been done so we tried to have them fix it. The manager accused us of trying to get free appetizers. All we wanted them to do was fix it. Another time we had a waiter tell us to hurry up because his shift was almost over and he wanted to leave. We had just gotten our food. Terrible service.
1	neg	train	"Worst restaurant I've been to in my 30+ years..The Puritan in manchester, NH is by far the worst I've visited. I visited their online site and found their prices to be a little higher than the other restaurants in the area like the 99 and such. Unfortunately you don't get what you pay for. Puritan does not allow reservations on Fridays and will only allow reservations for 5 or more during the other weeks days, so much for a romantic evening with a loved one. But I thought, hey the place is always packed and must be worth the wait. Unfortunatley the wait was quite long as the waiting room was always full on Fridays. I decided to try take-out instead. I ordered a clam roll and a ""bison"" burger. On the menu is says the Clam roll(9.95) comes with a kosher and fries. We received the clam roll, maybe 6 clams on the bread, the kosher dried out and a small bag of potato chips, interesting. The ""bison"" burger is not the only burger on the menu as they list a texas burger with the same toppings added. The ""bison"" burger is 5.95, a dollar more than the texan burger with the same toppings. One would assume that the bison burger is bigger than the texan because of the additional cost, so I ordered the ""bison"" burger assuming I'd get a big burger. Additionally the burgers come with lettuce,tomato,onion and mayo, plus the usual kosher and fries. I also ordered the extra toppings of bacon and cheese, an extra $1.20. Total burger cost was 7.15 before tax. What I received was not what I had ordered. I got a burger bun, a small black patty the size of a mcdonalds hamburger with a see through slice of cheese, fries smaller than a mcdonalds small fry and a dried out kosher. You'll take note I did not mention I received any toppings besides the cheese. Besides that, both meals were very cold 20 minutes after ordering as it was sitting in a stack of other take-out meals against a wall near the icecream bin. I tried to eat the burger, but had to rip it in half with both hands to get to the softer dried out parts. I gave up and through it out."
3	neg	train	Unbelievable food. This is a quick service place but when you eat you could swear you are at fine dining. Super busy...I guess the locals appreciate their good fortune. Highly recommended !
1	neg	train	Are you kidding me? The chili is weak and watered down, and is served on top of a plate of pasta that is cooked to within a minute of it giving up any texture. Throw some cheese on top and you've got a meal fit for a death row inmate.
1	neg	train	we ordered crabcakes the crab must have swam through it. very little crab alot of stuffing. Ordered baked stuffed shrimp dried out and burnt. My girlfriend ordered blacked sirloin it was not sirloin another cut of meat maybe chuck. Spoke to the manager Becky Murlck she said I could have sent it back. And wait another hour. I don't think so. I have been in food management for years and I believe that the way in which she handled it was less than appopriate. She seemed to have no customer service experience. I was very disopointed with the experience and felt that I don't want to go back and experience the same thing. I have been going for years and its just a disappointment. Thank you Gail Stanley 2B5 1 Hoskins Crossing Simsbury Ct 06070
1	neg	train	"I sat down with my plate and bit into a raw chicken liver and blood gushed out of my mouth. It sickened me and my family who saw this. I told the waitress who was concerned and she told the manager ""Jeff"" who sat eating his dinner three tables over. We waited for him to finish up and come over but finally decided that he didn't intend to. We got up to the register where we promptly asked for a refund and he finally came up there. He said that he would refund my part but not the rest of the group, because we had been there thirty min. I said yes waiting for you to handle this. Even my small daughter told him they didn't eat off their plate after that. He was rude and unconcerned. We left disgusted."
3	neg	train	Not bad. Nothing special. Sandwhiches get the job done, but don't jump out at you. Pizza's pretty good as well.
1	neg	train	This was really a great place to eat in 2004, and we've gone there many times and suggested many friends to do so. Suddenly, since the beginning of this year, the experience is very different - apparently the staff is new and very likely the chef who prepared us so many delicious meals is well gone.... Is it possible that some owners put a good chef to build the clientele of a new restaurant, then when it's done he's replaced by a 2nd zone crew? That was exactly our feeling there today. Since we had had such a good time in the past and don't give up easily on good habits, we decided to give Krung Thai a second chance today after a first very mediocre meal and service a couple of weeks ago - we know now that the good times are over, won't spend one more dime in this place.
3	neg	train	Excellent Breakfast in a historic storefront. Frequented by many of the local college community.
1	neg	train	One of the very worst experiences I ever had in a restaurant. Service was awful. People at the next table left because their food was so bad. Another couple left because they waited 20 minutes to get served. We were never asked if we wanted wine, nor were we told if there were any specials.
3	neg	train	"The atmosphere was wonderful. A little river with a rock bridge to walk over. Comfortable seating, trees, fans all over the place.. The food was very good and there was a sufficient amount. The drinks were yummy. There was a good selection of both. Prices were reasonable. The service however sucked. The waitress bragged about being the best server in the house, yet couldn't bring our drinks promptly, forgot that we had ordered water and messed up my order causing me to wait until what I really wanted was prepared. The other two at my table had finished their dinners by the time they finally brought it out. They offered us one free dessert due to the mix up, however by the time we got to that part no one was hungry, nor wanted to wait for another 15 minutes before she came back to say, ""oh they didn't bring it to you yet?"""
2	neg	train	El Fandango is a novel restaraunt for the tourist, but as for its ability to stand out among the mexican eateries of San Diego, it is sorely lacking in creativity, atmosphere, and uniqueness. I ordered the steak and shrimp combination plate. The steak (carne asada) was frightfully ordinary. The rice and beans were normal, and the three shrimp were plump, but not fabulous. The friend with whom I ate was only minimally impressed with her chicken fajita. It lacked in flavor and was terribly oily and greasy. Service was moderate in its speed. The outdoor seating is uncomfortable and noisy. The prices may seem managable to the tourist, but any San Diegan would agree that El Fandango's $10-$15 menu should be a $7-$10 menu.
2	neg	train	We thought the food was oily and too salty. Our waiter did a terrible job opening our wine. There was lipstick on the glass and cork in our wine. The place had bad acoustics. We sat in a corner where they used a spaceheater to warm us.
1	neg	train	Hard to get service, and once you got service it was really bad. They were very rude. Complaining to the manager does not do any good either. Food was served cold and not accurate. Review submitted by:
1	neg	train	The Hambergurs were realy good if you like Blue cheese. My grandother wanted a Hamberger without Blue cheese. Because she gets sick from it. We were suprised they did not offer any other burgers without it. And when she asked they Ruidly replyed, we only serve burgers with blue cheese on it. And we asked again if she could have it without it. And then the waitress said you should not have come here this is how we serve it and then walked away. I asked for the manager who was more plesent. But said we do great serving our burgers with blue cheese and if we wanted to get my grandmother a hamberger we should try another resturant. O.K I see that they have the burgers there way. But this was just a huge waist of time, waiting for the table and the arougant service. I wonder about people these days. How they follow the crowds. And that they will put up with people being nasty to them to be at a in place. Makeing the customer happy does not apply to Father's Office. They should never talk that way to 82 year old people.
3	neg	train	"Small, seafood restaurant and raw bar just off the ""strip"" in Myrtle Beach. Raw and steamed shellfish highlight the menu. Unfortunately, only one broiled entree is available--- the rest is fried."
3	neg	train	"A very nicely appointed Mexican restaurant. Unfortunately for me, there are freshly chopped onions on EVERYTHING!!!!! The Chicken Tortilla soup should be called ""Garlic Flavored Broth with a Huge Chunk of Avocado"". Everyone else appeared to be having a nice time--- not my cup of tea. Did I mention that the Margarita was like a lemon flavored water!?"
1	neg	train	hoprrible, just horrible
3	neg	train	Just a chain. Everyone konws the eye candy is great, but the food is just average. You can find better in Peoria
1	neg	train	Bad service. Had to get our own drinks. Had to go to the front and ask for check. Asked for things such as butter and they were never brought to the table. Food was cold probably due to the fact that food was brought 40 mins after ordering. When we complained to management, the manager did not care if we came back or not. Poor poor service.
2	neg	train	The person that wrote the first reveiw was a member of their staff. I am from Ocean Isle Beach and this I was by far one of the worst restaurants to dine at and one of the worst bars to hang out at in the area. Ihe owner was clueless and I guess that trickled down to his staff and the service reflected just that. Ihe food was average, but you could get the same dishes almost anywere else on in the area for much cheaper and be treated much better by the staff.
3	neg	train	More Irish/American, but still pretty darn good. The best thing about this place is the atmosphere. The kitchen's open late and the place is usually hopping.
1	neg	train	This was the worst resturant experience we have ever had. From the minute our group sat down the waitress was rude to us. She took our drink and appetizer order and brought them to us about 15 minutes later and began to walk off. Since we still had not ordered our meal we asked if we could go ahead and pur our order in, to which she replied she was going to wait for us to finish our appetizer. She walked off and helped a couple other tables before coming back to take our food order. An HOUR later everone around us that had arrived after we did, had been served and some had even paid and left. When we were finally able to get our waitress back to our table we simply asked her if our food would be out soon. In the middle of us asking her, she turned around and stormed off slamming a tray down on a table a short ways off. We finally had to find a manger and cancel our order. We left and will never go back.
2	neg	train	This warm, welcoming restaurant is tucked away in a leafy bough off Hwy 321 in beautiful Blowing Rock, NC. The bar is friendly and efficient - a good place to relax while waiting (short time) for a table. Lots of regulars are a sure sign of customer satisfaction. Service was good and the food better than expected. The duck was terrific; crisp and flavorful. Our party enjoyed the experience and would heartily recommend this spot over some others in town that seem to be better known. Go and enjoy!
3	neg	train	My wife and I have eaten here twice. It is on the East side of town approx 5 Mi. south of Nellis Air Force Base. We always get the Wor Wonton which is very big($7.95). The Chicken fried rice is good too. This Thai restaurant is very quiet if you get there close to closing time which is 10pm.
2	neg	train	The food was good, the service was horrible. My husband and I couldn't understand why we had to wait 30 mins for refills and why people we coming and going before we were even served our food. In all we were not happy.
2	neg	train	My husband, his parents & I visited Snapper's Waterfront Saloon & Restaurant on Monday, December 22 around 5 pm. When we arrived we waited for approx 10 minutes to be seated. Two servers ignored us and another 2 passed us off to other employees. It took 20 minutes for a server to take our drink order and another 15 to take our dinner order. While he wrote everything down, two of our orders came out wrong. We also never received our salads. Actually, when we reminded him he brought them well after we had started on our entrees. At the end of the meal, we expressed our concerns about the service to the manager. He appeared to be drunk and was indifferent. While, the location and setting are beautiful, that cannot make up for the horrible service.
3	neg	train	"Food in airports has gotten better over the years but is still not expected to be the best so Lefty's Grill obliged us on its hamburgers. Lefty's Grill is a bar and grill on United's B concourse at the Denver Airport(DEN).It's split in half with a non-bar side and a bar side. The bar side has the TVs. My wife thought her hamburger was good (""you can see and taste it"") but I thought it was OK(see House of Blues,Orlando). Bratwurst and various grill chickens are the other choices(I'll try one of them next time). Fries were sliced like potato chips and had some kind of tasty Cajun flavor but eat fast before they get cold. Lefty's is decorated with large B&W pictures of the Rocky Mtns and people enjoying the Rocky Mtns. I thought they worked but I like large B&W photos. Tables along the windows with a tarmac view are high 2 seater's. Service was adequate on the family side- better on the bar side."

2	neg	train	After being stuck in a horrible traffic jam and missing a boat in the Newport Christmas Parade, we decided to find a nearby restaurant and treat ourselves to a wonderful dinner. The folks at Restaurant Aubergine were packed, and they suggested Le Quai as being on par with their cuisine. We found a charming, small place, so dimly lit by candlelight that we coudln't read the menus. Our waiter gave us the briefest details about the specials and then tried to push a $175 bottle of wine on us. Prices were excessive for the quality and artfullness of the food. There is a difference between crass and class and this place definitely landed in the former. After a $36 3 oz slipper tail appetizer and a $15 gorgonzola/walnut salad that was mediocre and over-dressed, we had two flavorful main courses - the lamb chops and a chilean seabass, each hovering at the $28 mark. After two $7.50 cups of coffee (no refills) and a passable cobbler for dessert, we were handed a bill for over $125, which included two $10 split plate charges, tacky at best. The service was arrogant and patronizing, the prices extreme and the food was certainly not worth a second visit.
3	neg	train	service was not as expected. yes they were good looking, but need to improve. the food took forever to come out, was not hungry anymore by that time. did not get any apology from the management. would not recommend friends to go.
2	neg	train	All I can say is that the night was soured by our blonde server. She was very uptight and seemed angry all night. The food was alright, nothing to rave about. The martini's were good. Overall I would give them another chance but the service needs to improve.
2	neg	train	"One should be wary of all-you-can-eat experiences offered at bargain prices. Clearly, if a restaurant is offering too much for too little, in order to show a profit, something needs to be sacrificed - and usually it's the quality of the food. There are a bountiful number of choices here, a few of them actually edible, but for the most part the cuisine borders on the disastrous. You can't go wrong if you stick to the salad bar, where everything is fresh. It's the hot buffet selections that are the kitchen's downfall. Salt appears to be the only seasoning in use here, and there's far too much of it in everything. The pink meat warned us that the roast chicken was dangerously undercooked, whereas the bourbon chicken was burnt and tough. Meatloaf contained more bread filler than it did meat. The pot roast was fatty, overdone, too dry, and tasteless. French fries were perfect, but mashed potatoes needed to be doctored quite a bit. Pizza was underbaked, leaving the dough white and chewy. Television ads promise steaks 1"" thick, but you didn't need a ruler to see this claim is way off the mark. Steaks are precooked, then thrown on the grill to heat up, making rare impossible and medium rare unlikely. The fried onions offered with them were done well, but the mushrooms tasted boiled rather than sauteed. Soups were weak and flavorless. Desserts are plentiful and, for the most part, very good - just avoid the soft serve ""ice cream,"" which had a peculiar texture and taste. A nearby server was attentive to all her tables, but we had to request clean plates and drink refills several times before ours responded. The noise level is very high at peak dining times, and negotiating your way between tables and through the various food lines can be treacherous in a crowd. We had been here once before for Sunday brunch and had returned based on how pleased we had been with our meal, but obviously they do eggs far better than anything more ambitious. This is clearly a place popular with families and senior citizens on fixed incomes, but those who are seeking a decent meal and can afford higher prices definitely are advised to eat elsewhere."
2	neg	train	"If you're looking for good, authentic Chinese food DON'T head to Fun Lum Restaurant in Campbell California. My boyfriend and I went there last night & we were thoroughly disappointed. The exterior of the restaurant looks pretty nice, so we were expecting good food. Unfortunately,the food was overpriced and not at all appetizing. The potstickers were burnt on the outside - it was obvious the oil they used was too hot- as the outside dough that wasn't burnt was white & raw. The chow mein noodles were overcooked, stuck together and not seasoned well. The salt baked shrimp wasn't bad, but it was nothing to write home about. Also, steer clear of the Mushu Pork - the only flavor it had was salty and there was too much of that. Plus the ""pancakes"" for the Mushu were so dry they broke apart. What a disappointment. This place is like fast-food Chinese, but even then, I've had better for less $$. The food was not at all authentic. Being this close to San Francisco which has tons of great Chinese restaurants, I expected more."
1	neg	train	"This was one of the worst dinner I have ever had. There were six of us and two of the party ordered Veal Rissoto. When it came, one it smelled terrible and two it was impossible to eat. We all tried a sample and it was inedible for all of us. It wasn't even true rissoto. It was just plain rice. I had what they called swordfish. It was dry and about 3/8"" thick which probably explains the dryness. When the waitress came and asked at the END of the dinner how it was, and we complained about the Veal Rissoto, all she said was ""you either love it or you hate it"". Maybe she should have said that sooner? Like when we ordered it? I am doing my best to tell any and all that will listen to NEVER EVER go there. I hope I am successful and drive them out of business!"
2	neg	train	Out of 4 of us that went we all agreed that the food was just ok but definitely over priced. The atmosphere is unique and pleasant. We had to wait 1 hour for a table and it was not worth it at all.
1	neg	train	Staff was pushy and RUDE! Food was not that great. Steak was mostly fat!
1	neg	train	"The Coral Grill has been a landmark of the Florida Key's since the early 60's, known for it's huge, fresh and bountiful seafood buffet; it was very popular with locals and vacationers alike. Over the years the management / owners had switched hands several times and unfortunately every time there was a changing of the guard the quality of the food and service suffered. The Coral Grill was untimely the final owners drove the restaurant to the ground which lead to the closing of it's doors. For several years one would drive by and see the huge ""Coral Grill"" sign wishing that it would re-open. Then unexpectedly there was activity within the building and to our surprise the restaurant re-opened with a fourth installment of new management. We had hoped that the extended years of hibernation of the Coral Grill meant that perhaps someone who remember what the Coral Grill used to be famous for and perhaps would once again bring this ""world famous"" restaurant back to it's original grandeur. We decided to give her a try Unfortunately the Coral Grill is only but a miniscule representation of it's former self. Yes, the buffet is back but in a very, very small scale. The upstairs dinning room is still closed and the limited buffet is now in a room where ""lunch"" used to be served. Very depressing for those who used to wait an hour or more for a table to be rewarded for waiting by mountains of fresh seafood, mouth watering prime rib and a desert selection to die for. There were no lines and we got a seat immediately, which should have been a warning of what was to come. A rather attractive blond haired woman served us, however her attitude and customer service skills needed some major improvement. She acted as if we were bothering her, even more surprising when we noticed that the dining room was filled to about a fourth of it's capacity. The food, although of very limited quantity, was not bad. The prime rib was very tasty and the crab legs appeared fresh. Other items seemed picked over; the soups were watery and needed some more seasoning. Crab cakes, one of their specialties of days old, were not even close to what we remember. Salad bar was out of greens and the desert bar was populated with small pieces of some cake like substance, jello and what looked like ambrosia salad. If the price was about half of what we paid, I would have considered the meal almost expectable. But for what the Coral Grill is currently charging per person, there are far better seafood buffets, one of them is right across the street at the Whale Harbor Inn. It's a shame that the new owners seemed to think that people will flock to the restaurant based on it's name alone. What they failed to realize that people remember the food, the quantity and the quality, that's what brings them back. From the empty dinning room it's easy to understand that many people in the Florida Keys are aware that the days of the old Coral Grill are long gone."
3	neg	train	"We have not visited a Sizzler restaurant in nearly 10 years due to the fact that most of those that were located in our area no longer exist. We visited this surviving location in White Plains,New York looking forward to the huge salad bar/hot foods bar that we remembered from past visits to this location and others. Sadly,this Sizzler is not at all like we remembered it to be.The salad bar is approximately 75% smaller than it used to be and most of the items offered on it were very disappointing,to say the least. The taco meat(?) was a totally unidentifiable mess! The only memorable items on the salad bar were the New England Clam Chowder which was pretty decent,and the corn fritters. Our entrees were fairly good. My wife had and enjoyed their Malibu Chicken which consisted of breaded chicken breast pieces stuffed with ham and cheese. I had the grilled chicken breast with Fettucini Alfredo which was pretty good except for the fettucini being a bit too ""al dente"" for my taste. Unfortunately Sizzler is just not as good as we remember.We may give this restaurant another try if we are ever in the area again,but it is definitely not worth going out of one's way to visit!"
1	neg	train	We didn't enjoy it.
2	neg	train	The birthday party was intended to be a pleasant experience.....not an event in which our party felt like we should squeegie windows in order to eat there. The party started off with a rude confirmation on the reservation. The hostess was rude and was not hospitable to our requests. I do not understand why we should be required to order a 35 dollar set menu for our party when we made it clear that some of our party were only joining us so a drink. They finally agreed to let us order a la carte. We started off with some satays.....we should have started off with our bill. The satays had as much meat on them as you whould get from one McDonalds french fry. The remaining appetizers were ok..just stay away from the crab and scallop starter. For fourteen dollars you would expect a hell of alot more than the 2 oz of crab and the 2 mini scallops that we got. Our entrees were over done and my Venison came with a potato hash that more resembled McCain Fries. The entrees were not creative and I felt like I was on an airplane when I received them. What a rip off!! Happy birthday to my friend? More like happy birthday to Glowbal who got the best present of the evening...OUR MONEY!!!!
3	neg	train	The Shoreline Buffet is a newly opened Chinese style buffet restaurant located on the Post Road in Branford, Connecticut.The dining room is very attractive,but the floor is so highly polished that it was like walking on ice!We were wearing sneakers and still nearly fell several times!Their dinner buffet for $12.99 is about $3.00 to $4.00 more expensive than most other such restaurants in the general area and is definitely not worth paying extra for!The crab rangoon,which is one of my favorite dishes,had a strange,almost chemical flavor.Most of the other dishes were composed of basically the same ingredients with very little difference between them.Spices and flavorings were severely lacking.They did have a fairly decent carved roast beef and the chilled shrimp were large and properly cooked.The only thing about the chilled shrimp that concerned me was that the raw bar was located directly behind them resulting in juices from the raw shellfish dripping on the shrimp whenever a patron served themselves shellfish.There are many better and less expensive dining options in this area.If they were to drop their price by $4.00,strip a few layers of wax off their floor and add some more variety and seasonings to their food,they might be worth trying!
3	neg	train	True Italian food. If your looking for Americanized Italian food, try someplace else. This place is the real deal. Really fancy place. Not really a lunch spot, but a great date restaurant.
2	neg	train	1. We were seated abruptly. Served in a rush. And the food was bland. No service. No Kind attitude. and the food's presentation was Denny's at its best. I would not even recommend this place to my enemies. Review submitted by: Aaron Bissinger 2. This was the worst dining experience of my life. This is definitely a turn it and burn it place disguised as a nice restaurant. I had not finished my cocktail when our appetizers arrived(acceptable), we had not finished our appetizers when our entrees arrived(still have that drink to boot). My food was less then fair and who serves carrots with sweet potato?? Orange must be in this season. Not to mention I found it very unnerving to have the hostess prowling the floor every 5 seconds making feel like I wasn't eating fast enough. We had paid our bill and I still hadn't finished my martini. The food was crap, the service was crap, but the building is pretty. Both myself and my companion are chefs and we learned how not run our establishment from this sole experience.
1	neg	train	This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. After we had waited about 45 minutes, we noticed several parties being seated who had come in after we did. When we inquired as to why other parties were being seated before us, she immediately became defensive and argumentative, telling us that it was her mother-in-law and she would always seat her mother-in-law ahead of everybody. She said this was her restaurant and she would run it any way she wanted. If we didn't like it, she said, we should leave. When I attempted to point out that more than one party had been seated ahead of us and one of the parties consisted of four young men (obviously, not one of which could have been her mother-in-law), she called me a liar. Not once did she make any attempt to solve the problem, but instead was extremely rude. Never were we treated with any amount of courtesy and respect. Her attitude was that we were merely customers and might be seated only when she decided that we were worthy of getting a table. She also told us that we hadn't informed the hostess when we arrived that we didn't have a coupon and because we didn't say we didn't have a coupon, they assume we do have a coupon. She further explained that all customers with coupons are seated last. I couldn't quite understand how we were supposed to know to tell them we didn't have a coupon when not only did we not have the coupon but knew nothing about it. The hostess never asked us whether we had this elusive coupon. It was obvious that this manager/owner cares nothing at all about her customers. We didn't bother to stay to eat. We'd been there before and knew the food wasn't worth putting up with that kind of treatment.
2	neg	train	The salad bar had certain foods that were spoiled...my friend had ordered a salad which had moldy tomatos and the waitress was a complete cluts spilling a glass of tomato juice on my fathers hat. The bathrooms were horrible every stall was gross!! Now maybe times have changed but that was a evening we would not forget I know I would never go back there and eat!
1	neg	train	Of the five times I have eaten at Hornblowers, there has been a hair in my food twice! The fact that this occurred in two of five visits indicates to me that it is not an isolated case. Needless to say, I will never dine there again. Lunch service does not always require reservations, but the service is very slow (20 to 45 minutes from order to service). I once attempted dinner: a two-hour wait (I didn't).
3	neg	train	"We went to the ""Muddy Moose"" on our vacation twice. The first time was fine, although it was very drafty. It was nothing to write home about, and I didn't even want to return except that the next day at lunch time, we tried to dine at the restaurant next door to the ""Muddy Moose"" but it was closed until the evening. So we went back a second time. A gentleman sat us at a table next to the kitchen (if we'd been any closer, we would have been IN the kitchen), even though the place was near empty. He asked us if we wanted a booster seat or highchair. I said high chair, but we'd get it ourselves. So I do, and a very rude woman comes over and states that I can't put a high chair in the isle and ""asks"" us if we'd mind moving. I told her if they had straps on their booster seats, I wouldn't mind not using a highchair and sitting where we were, but they didn't. She huffed away, practically running to our new table, then as she passed me, got way too close to me and said, full of attitude, that it was against fire code to put a high chair in the isle and asked me if our new table was okay. Our server was nice, but brought regular Pepsi instead of Diet. They bring ""treats"" out and hand them directly to your child when s/he is done with their children's meal, but don't bother to tell you that they're Oreos. I have a 19 month old and I'm not crazy about her eating sugar, and I have a problem with them not only NOT asking me if it's okay first, but handing them directly to my daughter instead of slipping them to me. That's just a temper tantrum waiting to happen! They had good clam chowder and fried fish and maybe the best fries I've ever had, but because of the above experiences, I wouldn't return. Too much hassle."
1	neg	train	T'his resturant has gone downhill. I do admit it USED to be a great place. Lately the service has been horrible and the food has tasted old. The chips were stale and cold and the food took forever to arrive and when it did it was room temp. I would not recommend this resturant to my worst enemy.
1	neg	train	Service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life. it took them a good 15 minutes just to come over and take our drink order another 15 minutes to get us our drinks and another 10 minutes to come back to take our order. good thing we did not order appetizers. then when they bring us our drinks they did not bring any sugar for our tea, order hot tea for two and they bring these little ity bity hot water container for one plus only one tea bag. once we received our meal not once did the server come back to the table to see how everything was. once he finally returned we had finished our meal and we requested the check, well another 15 minutes go by nothing. had to ask another server to get our check and the manager was never around to ask what was the matter. we will never again go to this place again. and the food had no flavor what so ever. the servers suck and the management sucks....and they left many tables dirty for 30 minutes or more. yuk.........
1	neg	train	I ordered Pepper Steak w/onions and fried rice. The green peppers and onions were pratically raw and the meal was very bland. Not at all what I expected. The fried rice had so much garlic in it that I could not eat it. I told the waitress that I did not like the food and would like something else. She told me that I must pay for both meals if I wanted something else. I declined, waited for my wife and daughter to finish their meals and we left. I will never return to that restaurant again. While I was waiting to leave a customer at the counter had returned to advise the waitress that he did not get egg rolls with his combination meals that he had picked up earlier and the waitress started an argument with the customer! Sadly, the patients are running the asylum!!
1	neg	train	When we arrived we were told that the wait would be a half hour for a table. We decided to wait. the group that came in after us with 15 were seated before my group of 3. We ended up waiting 45 minutes for a table, 15 minutes for a waitress and by that time they had sold out of fish fry's. This was at 8pm on a friday night. It took 30 minutes to get our orders. I do not recommend this restaurant and will be sure to let everyone in the Buffalo, Western New York area know this.
1	neg	train	"I'm not going to review the atmosphere or the entertainment, because I'm sure young children think it's *mildly* exciting to see somebody dive off a waterfall. However, the food was absolutely horrible. I'm amazed this place has been in business since the late 60's/early 70's. I wouldn't give the food to my dog, let alone the poor starving rat living in my garage. After eating one plate of the ""all you can eat"" garbage, I immediatly felt sick to my stomach. It was not a pleasant sensation, and the gurgling taking place deep in my bowels was similar to the effects of drinking a gallon of milk, followed by $8 worth of Taco Bell, and chased with a can of refried beans. Which remindes me, the ""refried beans"" (put in quotes because I'm not sure what they actually were) resembled more of a dry, scaly pile of mud mixed with a little sand, and maybe some cat vomit. Next time, if you're looking for something that's edible for $9.99, feed your cat some popcorn and cheese, wait for it to vomit, and eat that instead."
1	neg	train	I just phoned to make a reservation and the girl at the restaurant who answered was unpolite and very pushy to the point where I just hung up on her. Horrible, before I even stepped foot in the restaurant.
3	neg	train	Eh, this place is OK for the 20 something's that don't know any better. Morton's is just up the street and a much better restaurant by far. The food is adequate, the staff adequate, the atmosphere adequate. You'll pay a bit more here just so the place can pretend it's in the same league as the big boys. Heck - there were flies buzzing around the place when we ate there!
2	neg	train	Have been to other Todai's this one is very poor. Smells bad, looks dirty (like the building is very old). Selection of food not as good as other Todias. Did not put more food out fast enough On top of all that parking sucks I will not return
2	neg	train	Referring to the other mail of Ms Malvika where she said that the place was awesome and ooooh the owner winked and said its his job to know etc etc....ho humm how boring....you need to know the owner honeh !!!.......dont you know its his way of winning you women over by giving these silly one liners and acting all witty and know it all!!!! Relax!.....
3	neg	train	How do I possibly begin to describe my experience? It was dark chocolate, sex, naughtiness, and ecstacy all rolled into a tiny twisty pretzel! Our waiter, David, was wonderful. Not only did he take the time to give us his personal opinion on each and every menu item, he paid (out of his own pocket) for my wife's prescription refill of Norvasc (the anti-hypertensive, not the cholesterol-lowering drug). Anyway, I ordered the grouper and it was heaven! You know that split-second feeling you get when you lean back on a chair, are about to fall, but don't? That best describes my grouper. Oh mama mia! After dinner, be sure to take a stroll on the beach (watch out for the sand nipples!). Overall, a great experience.
2	neg	train	The food was either over cooked or not cooked enough we started out wit a appetizer Potato skins the skins were not done and rubbery , next I ordered a burger medeum it came out well done and chared .I gave the waiter a 20.00 gift certifacate he said he was going to deduct it from the check and he did not ,I realized later after I already Paid him,
3	neg	train	My wife and I were happy to be able to get a reservation at Casanova's, since we heard how good it was from a trusted friend. Once we were seated, we took our time going through the VAST wine list and probably took a little too long, but what can they expect? Once we ordered our food and wine, the wine was brought over and we did the taste and pour routine. After that, we were on our own for topping off our glasses. Never mind that this was a 98 point Wine Spectator selection that was $195 for the bottle.... The food was very good, but it was just dropped off with no explanation of what it was on the plate, how it was prepared or anything of the sort. I have come to expect a certain level of satisfaction from paying this much for a meal, since it is really intended to be an experience, but Casanova's did not deliver for us. We have a place we go on a regular basis in downtown Modesto, Ca that is about 2/3 the cost for food, 3x the value for the money and has a wait staff that caters to your every need. We will stick to our local dinner place... It is too bad, since we were prepared to be impressed and the only thing that we really, really enjoyed was the soufle crepes for desert and the company of each other.
1	neg	train	This was such a bad experience. Highly touted by the locals...it was like walking into a 1968 nightmare. Not Recommended!
2	neg	train	I have gone once with my husband, and he has gone a total of 3 times. When I went, it was busy, but the wait for a waiter once we were seated was over half an hour, and then the food was well over 45 minutes after THAT, including the appetizer we had ordered to take the edge off. The employees were cheerful and seemed friendly, IF you could get the attention of one after being seated. The food was good, but by the time we got it to the table we were so ravenous we probably rushed thru it because we had not planned on waiting over an hour for our food! The decor is cute, and the hustle and bustle does tell you that the place is busy but I have been to places busier, and they were still able to get someone to wait on tables in less than half an hour after seating, and get the food to the table in under 45 minutes. When I said the delay was terrible, my husband said it was just about the same every time he had gone, except the last time he went they had not only been late, but brought the WRONG entree. I am not interested in going back! Too bad they can't get their act together, they would be able to serve many more customers and make more money if they were better about expediting!
2	neg	train	When not enjoying Kauai Oceanfront, see mypoipubeach.com one likely finds oneself in Honolulu, which means Waikiki. At the start of Waikiki, but not the scene, on one of the streets from a time before the automobile dominated planning, sits Pearl at number 432. Ena Road, like an alley winds between high rises and some low, tawdry commercial buildings. The hint of commercial sex hangs thereabouts, what with some particularly seedy karaoke establishments. All this, a block from my hotel and a hurdle across the relentless traffic of what was Ala Moana boulevard and has become Kalakaua Avenue heading East toward Diamonhead. Another hint this city was not planned, but carelessly grown by the water. In the Midwest of my younger years, the unbroken, rigid, right angled grid of the city streets gave me no hint that a city should be otherwise. Poh, letterd on the Ena Road windows, this must be Pearl in Vietnamese? Poh further identifies itself as a Vietnamese Bistro. After all, I think, the French did occupy Vietnam, before tricking ante anti-imperialist America to sub for it. But this Bistro does not display any French style. White table clothes on the tables, but they stay pristine, under plexiglass sheets, which give off the brightest glow, reflecting the abundant neon lights above. White lighting tubes, for all their efficiency, do not shine stylishly. More reminiscent of my junior high lunch room, the dinning tables similarly arranged in unimaginative rows. Like the lighting, I suppose, an efficient use of space for all the eager diners. Although, when I passed by on occasion, there were more seats inviting then occupied, by a ratio of ten to one. In this simple fact a prospective diner finds no recommendation. At the far end of the Bistro the ever on TV presides at the bar/register counter, just like the competing Vietnamese Cafe at the start of the block, no bistro appellation there. Adjacent, cold beverages stand on display to the dining room behind the glass door of the Turbo Air refrigerator. Yummy. On top an early or late ceramic rendition of what I think is a Hello Kitty, but latter learn more probably a good luck cat. Cute: one of the mysteries of the East. In the corner, just next to the Turbo Air a murky, very large aquarium, a few languid fish, presumably not for menu selection, bestir themselves. On top of the aquarium one white pedestal flower pot with permanent pale green vegetation and lavender blooms, all nicely symmetrical, as nature intended. On the left and right walls, two commercial calendars on the walls, one from Song & Song, the other Wongs Produce. Further down the left, a gold and red oriental tapestry, significance of han characters unknown to me, followed by a very large psychedelic colored painting of a whale breached in silhouette against an oval shape. Does this rival the Sattchi gallery on the Thames? Further, on a wall outcropping, a sign: Buffalo Wings $5.95. Next, two still lives of single floral bouquets, centering a further posted sign with the seemingly tardy advice: Pearls, Parking Available. My dinner, No. 48 Vegetables Sauteed in Season w/Tofu $7.95. The Tofu, was indeed an afterthought. Front window festooned with dangling xmas lights, white bulbs. This marketing effort had hooked this one discerning dinner. The program on TV is called fIT TV, coming soon to a box near you. A couple, overweight, are closely pictured, partially unclothed in equal measure with the tasteless premise, and a plan for rehabilitation made with the know-it-all program moderator. Said know-it-all better turned out then her subjects. The program then tracks the couple's fit progress in their indeterminate succeeding days of healthful activity. The character development appears thinner than these figures, and the outcome of the plot missing, as the box segued to another commercial message. Therein, the actors if not the subject, found far more attractive. I cleared my tears from the overdose of Vietnamese sauce, likewise my nasal passages, and settled the account at the cash register near the TV box, no gratuity just like France, and exited 432 to Ena Road. I cannot swear I will return; but when not enjoying Kauai Oceanfront, see mypoipubeach.com one likely finds oneself in Honolulu, which means Waikiki.
1	neg	train	And I don't know what the last person is talking about! Maybe they drank too much at happy hour to notice their food! It's not yummy, and not affordable! They use the cheapest, poorest quality ingredients and the service sucks, and they definitely are trying to rip people off!
1	neg	train	Mid afternoon visit on a March Saturday - 2/3 of the tables were full, service was lousy, food was worse- There was a table with a real dog sitting in a chair eating out of a plate. The wait staff were petting it instead of attending the tables- The health dept should be notified.
3	neg	train	We spend a week vacationing every fall in Lancaster County,Pa and usually dine at the King Buffet in Lancaster on one night. This year we decided to try Ming Court for a change as we had read great reviews of their food, especially their grill. The food at Ming Court was not terrible,but it was far from what the reviews indicated.The much touted grill was not even running. We wish that we had gone to King Buffet as the food there is much more flavorful and a much wider variety is offered.
2	neg	train	Fridays attempt at entertainment dinning. A huge building on I drive with and arcade and pool tables. Menu is very limiting as most dishes are fried or smothered in cheese. The lettuce in thier salad is chopped iceberg. With all the options in Orlando I would avoided this place next time.
1	neg	train	it was wank
3	neg	train	We eat here regularly before concerts, for the convenience, the friendliness and the modest prices. The menu includes a wide variety of steaks, Greek and Italian dishes. The drinks are generous, and they are very nice about substitutions. Night owls should know that they are open until 4 AM -- and they serve lunch and dinner seven days a week.
1	neg	train	The food was absolutely terrible. I ordered seafood lasagna and the noodles were hard and crunchy and it seemed as if they served me the last piece in the pan from the night before. The spinach salad was tasteless. Yuck. I would not go back.
1	neg	train	They advertise a lunch buffet from 11:30 am to 2:00 pm. I arrived at 1:30 and was refused service. I suppose it's not worthwhile for them to remain open for one person.
1	neg	train	"Generally this is a very HOSTILE restaurant. We had very unpleasant experience with them. As a Chinese, I am really shame of this restaurant. As a traditional Chinese courtesy, my friends want to treat us and pay the bill. So she hold the bill in her hands to avoid my argument. Address it again: this is nothing special but a Chinese style courtesy, if you were Chinese, you definitely understand what I mean. However, their waitress keeps bugging us to put it on the table, if this is their rule - fine, but her tone is very very unfriendly and unprofessional, sounds like we are gonna leave upaid. I explained to her that we were about to leave and ready to pay. After a while, one of their lobby guy came and urged us to leave because he declared there is a 1.5 hour limit, bullshit! we were angry, and another lobby came again to address their ""1.5 hour"" policy - although I have no idea how long we stayed. We tried to contact their manager to complain, however their operator cannot connect to the manager - deliberately or not. This is not over yet, we will keep contacting their manager until it is solved. I have been many chinese restaurants in United Stated, from western coast to eastern coast, and been treated well always, but this one is an exception, a real exception. So all in all, if you try to eat in this restaurant, bring you a clock ready for their 1.5-hour limit, and ready for any sudden insult they like to put on you, especially advised your friends first to avoid unnecessary surprise and embarrasement. Shame on you, East buffet!"

We coudn't order wine due to elections being held the next day. My husband's food was so horrible, heavily laden with curry, that he had to have it removed. Service? As soon as they realized we were using the coupon from the Marriott Vacation Club, service was virtually non-existent, and we had to wave down our server to get anything we needed. Don't waste your money here, folks -- try Madame Janette's instead -- it's WONDERUL!"
2	neg	train	Out for a family dinner. Place looks nice. One of 4 entres was clearly over-spiced (hot even by Asian standards). Waiter was dismissive. Suggested we use their internet survey to voice our concern, but the survey site does not work. The combination of a disfunctional facility and dysfunctional website bode poorly for their quality. Don't go there.

1	neg	train	DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT. I AM CONVINCED THE MANAGEMENT IS CONSPIRING TO RIP PEOPLE OFF. I have eaten here twice. Both times, my orders came up wrong - and both times, there were missing ingredients. These were always, always the most expensive ingredients listed on the menu - the guacamole, the avocado or the portabello mushrooms. The other night I ate there and I had to send my food back TWICE before it came back correct. My boyfriend's burrito was missing sour cream, guacamole and salsa, and when we asked the waiter for the missing ingredients he only gave us the avocado. Furthermore, the rice was NOT COOKED all the way. The waiter was never around, so we couldn't complain. And the food was not even tasty, after all this. Finally at the end of the meal we asked the waiter to speak with the manager - and he actually scolded us for not telling him sooner (our waiter wasn't even around!) then told us the same rice was served all day, implying that we were WRONG....and refused to do anything about it. He told us we ate the food so there was nothing he could do. (Unfortunately the waiter took our food so we couldn't show him that we actually barely touched the food.) He said (and was backed up by others working there) that they have NO AUTHORITY to take charges off a customer's bill. First of all, this has to be a lie, because if the waiter accidentally rang up something that hadn't been ordered, of course it would be possible to remove it - and our bill hadn't even been rung up yet. I think this restaurant lists things on their menu to make them look good, and then leaves off the most expensive ingredients playing the chance that a lot of people won't notice. A friend of mine ate there last night and told me they left off her avocado until she asked for it, and that's when I got fed up and decided to write this review. I am very upset that this restaurant is profiting with bad food, bad service, ridiculously expensive meals for the quality, all while trying to screw people over. It's not fair, and please, please do not help them do this.
1	neg	train	I had a bad time at the mini restaurant. A dark asian man Joe I recall harassed me embarrassed me in front of my family. I was about to eat my lunch plate until I saw something moving in it. My wife was asking what was wrong before I could even answer her the dark asian man aka Joe told me what's wrong you're on a diet. I admit I might have some weight on me but it was rude and disrespectful. I replied to him there's something in my food and he said of course there is there's rice orange chicken and all the stuff you ordered. I tried to explain that there was stuff other then what I ordered. He started embarassing me in front of my family and everyone around us. I was just trying to have a nice sunday afternoon with my wife and kids but this guy ruined my day. The food there from my experience was disgusting. It was nothing like what the flyers said it was going to be. I tried to explain to him about what was wrong but he lost his temper and went balistic. I hope the people who worked there last year when I came comes back because my experience with them was great and I hope the boss gets this message and fires Joe.
1	neg	train	Well, my big family, when to celebrate my dad's birthday on Sat. 8/21. We weren't looking for the free meal for my dad cuz I knew from past experiences that it has to be the date exactly for that. We were there 1 day later. That wasn't the problem. We were told, one of my nieces, who is 10years old under 5ft, will be charged full adult price. I thought okay no problem I guess the child under 5ft over 4ft had to pay full price. After our bill came and we paid and on the way out we saw on the wall stating that under 5feet child over 4feet pay 1/2 price. Therefore, we brought it up to the clerk. They measured my niece and figured out they over charged us. Well, here comes the problem. They said because the transaction was closed they could not give us a credit back to our credit card but would give us a voucher for future use (which from experience, cannot be used in any other Todai except the issuing Todai) with an expiration date of 2 months from the issuing date. Well, first of all, we didn't go to Todai and spent 300.00 and have this type of problems. Secondly, in any other restaurants, retail establishment, and stores, don't have a problem to fix it with just a simple credit transaction, only in Todai, they are not able to do a credit transaction. None of their promotions are interchangeable. For example, on average we spend about 300.00 in Todai because of our big family. Todai has a point system to give credits back to the customer. But guess what, the points are not accurable together with the other todai's in the area. Each Todai's points are only for that individual todai. So what is the use of the points system? They had a promotion of Free drinks for the month of August. I was told because I had a coupon from american express for 15% off, I will not be able to get free drinks. Okay, I understand that. But then they tell me Oh, and the 15% off, is only for paying adults, not for Childs rate or senior rates. And them being so sticky with every little situations, then if they were not going to give us 15%off for the senior or child rates, then shouldn't they get officially, because the child and seniors are not using any sort of coupons get the drinks????? They didn't. Because we were in the same bill, they couldn't give them the drinks. What fustrates me is that we spent not chum-change.. we spent 300.00 each time we go there and every todai treats people like that.
1	neg	train	Let me make it very simple. In a restaurant the most important food is the french fries or hash browns. This is because with almost every dish you will be getting a side order of either french fries or mashed potaoes. I can go into how bad their other dishes are including their mashed potatoes but lets stick to something simple like french fries. French fries need to be well cooked on the inside and crispy on the outside. At beadles neither is done. I cook better fries and I'm only a commercial truck driver. If you have a cook that cannot cook french fries then it's time to get an entirely different cook and I don't mean his brother either.
2	neg	train	"We go to Spring Training every year to watch the Phillies and play golf. Our favorite haunt for may years was the ""Harp and Thistle"" in St.Pete's beach which closed suddenly last year. We have been looking for a replacement bar to hang out each nite we are in the area. We were told by Madeira beach natives that O'Keefee's was a great bar. On Friday nite 3/14/03 four of us went to O'keefe's after a Phillies game for drinks and appetizers. The place was all decked out for St. Patrick's Day and was jumping for 4PM. I thought the place was great until we got the bill. They have the gall to charge $8 for Newcastle Brown Ale, $7 for Killians and $6 for Guiness. Terribly overpriced for the atmosphere since there wasn't any entertainment going on. The Harp charged $4 for Guiness and Irish bands were brought in. We are done with O'Keefe's until they lower their prices."
2	neg	train	Service was slow and crablegs were cool when served - Had to request items several times - Did not think food was worth the money -
3	neg	train	Unique sushi resturant with two large screen TVs that dominate two walls. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Many sushi rolls and combinations are offered.
3	neg	train	The service was fast & the food was a little to hot for me but it was good & it was enough for lunch.
3	neg	train	Noisy dining room with music, quick service, not much atmosphere, but great BBQ, with ribs and brisket as good as I remember them in Texas. Pearson also runs a quieter location in Jackson Hts Queens, where takeout is also available.
1	neg	train	"When we were in town, we really got ""special attention"", especially from the chef (in and out of the kitchen)"
3	neg	train	One of the few Greek places in Central Illinois. The people that own the place are just outstanding people. The food is pretty good. They have some non-greek items on the menu, but they're not always what you'd expect, so make sure your aware of what's on something before ordering. This place also doubles as a little market selling ingredients common in greek cooking. If your looking for this particular kind of food, this is the place to get.
2	neg	train	"Thirty minutes after we ordered our food we had still not received the salad/bread and the server approached us to tell us there was no lasagna available and we'd have to re-order. People arriving after us and sitting in another station to our right received their salad/bread within a few minutes of ordering. We waited another half an hour at which time both of our entrees were served, however, the grilled chicken was not provided with my pasta like it was supposed to be. The server commented the cook was still preparing it and she'd bring it later. Since I had no desire to eat half the entree, I waited another ten minutes until the chicken arrived. Meanwhile, the diners in the other station were all either gone, or finsihing up their meals as we just began ours. Later, I asked to speak to the manager. A very young man arrived at our table asking what we needed. I asked if he was the manager and he replied, ""no, he sent me because he's too busy"". I told him I would need to speak to the manager regardless. About 10 minutes later he arrived. I shared with him the facts regarding the length of time it took to serve us and how my entree had been served in two parts. I also let him know I did not appreciate his sending out a younger employee to speak to us because he was ""too busy."" The man was totally unapologetic. All he would offer is that our server had more tables than others and that we needed to understand that. He also said we should be understanding that the restaurant is a small business and that he was in the kitchen helping the cook prepare food. I told him none of that should be our concern. He was very cold and no matter which way I presented the problem would not apologize or offer any type of remedy. I told him I didn't think he cared for customers much and that I didn't see any reason why we should return to the restaurant. He shrugged and said that would be okay. We were enraged at his behavior and total lack of concern for our satisfaction. He pretty much made it clear he did not care if we ever returned. It's hard to believe that would happen in this day of customer service. Just so you don't get the wrong idea, neither of us were rude to this man. To be fair, we have been to two other Strings cafes in Roseville and Fairfield and had no problems whatsover."
1	neg	train	Went there with my kids for Lunch, Half an hour later our order still had not been taken. We wanted Soup and were told this would take some time, OK we waited for 1 hour and then left. I wrote to complain - no reply! Ever.
2	neg	train	Great place in the downtown area of toms river. I thought they have good prices and great food. The only thing that needs inprovement where you enter in to the restaurant, there is no room, too crowded!
3	neg	train	"A claasic Steakhouse. Dark interior, open kitchen, aged beef, sides served ala carte. Nothing unique about preperations or presentation. The staff is friendly and helpfull. The wine list is above average. Not the type of place that has me saying"" need to go back next time I'm in town"""
1	neg	train	We had a terrible experience here. The food was terribly overpriced for it's quality- there were several human hairs in my salad and an ant in my drink. No apologies from the server or manager. Disgusting.
2	neg	train	"False advertising: how cheap can you get??? The sign in the window advertises an ""all you can eat"" buffet, 7 days a week, for $6.95. Cool. This is a good way for me to introduce newcomers to the cuisine. We went for just this purpose on Sunday, October 5, 2003. We are not the type of people who load our plates to the sky and pig out like it's our last meal. Instead, we take an assortment of small samples to taste and not waste, to decide what we like best, always being careful to take no more than we will be able to eat, whether we really like it or not. This approach seems civilized. As a result, we make several small return trips but are careful not to be wasteful. As such, we were surprised to see the sign INSIDE, right over the buffet offerings, stating that "" to hold down costs"" we were limited to two plates. ""Additional plates"" were charged $1.00 each extra. I wondered if this was to save on dishes since most buffets request that you take a clean plate each time. I asked the waiter, who informed me that no, it meant two trips to the buffet. So the $6.95 ""all-you-can-eat"" is NOT the case. It's $6.95 for all you can eat if you want to overload two plates in anticipation of all you MIGHT want to eat If you want to be civilized and make several reasonable return trips, it will be $7.95, or $8.95 or Compare this to the Akbar, which features a TRUE ""all you can eat"" champagne buffet for $8.95. Not only is the Akbar cuisine far superior yet comparably priced, there are more items and a better variety (Indian Delight dishes contained either chicken or vegetables; Akbar has always included at least one additional meat besides chicken) and the service is better: You receive complimentary pappad and sauces. Beverage (champagne or your choice of another) is included, and water glasses refilled regularly. A salad and dessert is included in the buffet. At Indian Delight, we had water (no ice) and the glasses were never refilled. There was no dessert and we had to use coffee cups for the soup. The food was edible, but not outstanding. If you really want to eat well, go to Akbar (Liberty Road) or India Palace in Columbia. Heck, every other Indian restaurant we've been to has been better than the Indian Delight in every aspect."
1	neg	train	The food was okay but there was a mathematical error in our bill. Two people who ordered cappuccino requested a refill and were charged for a new item coffee at $1.25 each. The server added $6.00 to our bill and when we brought it to the attention of the owner she got extremely irate with us and threw us out of the restaurant! It was the first time any of us had experienced anything like this. All we did was request that the coffee be charged to us at the correct price although we did question the policy of charging for coffee when you have already paid $4.00 for a cappuccino.
1	neg	train	"We told the owner/manager that our food had no flavor. He reacted by saying ""What do you expect from baked ziti?"" We had been to this restaurant 4 times previously and were astounded by his reaction, almost accusing us of ordering the wrong item from the menu. He made no attempt to apologize for the food, just got angry and left."
1	neg	train	"We attempted to go for brunch after locating a positive review. After calling to see if reservations were required or recommended for ""brunch"" we were told no. Upon arrival, not only were we told Brunch wasn't being served until SEPTEMBER (a full 2 months away) but the kitchen refused to make a single omlette for one of our party who happened to be vegetarian (they weren't set up for it?? 1 omlette??!!) We were barely offered an apology for the misunderstanding. They have no interest in customer relations which is a shame because we get together quite frequently as a group and I plan to tell anyone who will listen about my absolute worst dining experience."
2	neg	train	"Bennigan's service in a 5-star environment. The Dralion is more than just over-rated, it's over-priced and sub-par for a place which touts itself as a ""fine dining"" restaurant. Sure the decor is lovely, and the food was tasty (once it finally arrived an hour after ordering). However, the wait staff was lacking in any ""fine-dining"" training whatsoever. Our young & giddy waitress was far too informal and chatty with our table, even going as far as rubbing my boyfriend's shaven head, asking to see a ring on one of our guests' fingers, and making jokes about waitresses from Hooters, which, I might add, is likely where she received her training. This, my friends, is not in line with any 5-star dining I've ever enjoyed. No apologies, just excuses from the wait staff about how late the food was and how slow the service was. The non-certified (and very young) sommelier was also sub-par in mannerisms and in talent. When we ordered a bottle of Chardonney that was no longer in stock, he attempted to upgrade our selection with a much more pricey label without even informing us of the price jump. I would not have minded the bubble-gum-service if I was paying 2- or 3-star prices, wearing jeans and a t-shirt, but for a place where a side of mash potatoes is pricier than a huge plate of Hooter's hot-wings, you'd think they could afford to hire some wait staff with class. Very disappointing, considering the hype it has recieved. I won't be back, given the selection of ""real"" fine-dining restaurants Dallas has to offer. Even sister-restaurant ""Steel"" exhibits more class; makes you wonder why they don't lend some professional training to it's struggling sibling-- merely a ""wanna-be"" in the fine-dining arena. This was a waste of time & money."
1	neg	train	Be very careful if you charge your meal. I was charged three times on the same evening; twice for the same amount and once for triple that amount. It has been over a month and there has been no resolution. Use cash if you go and keep your credit cards safely in your wallet.
2	neg	train	"What a waste of $16.00 (which included a tip of $2). Will not return. First of all, they charge extra and tack on additional prices to your ticket for such things as delivery (although menus state delivery is free), paying by check, and requestion even the smalled change to an order (such as requesting fried rice with no veggies). In addition, the shrimp fried rice was an extra charge, only to have so little shrimp in the fried rice I might as well have saved my money and just ordered plain fried rice, oh, except for the fact that I would have still be charged extra for the ""effort"" it takes to not put veggies in it. Also, I requested that they be careful to not overcook the crab rangoon, only to have to break the corners off because they were so overcooked and hard. All in all, 15% of my bill was for ""extras"" that should never be considered extras when satisfying the simplest of customer service requests. The food was less than satisfying, the extra charges did nothing to help their customer service, and now I am ticked off at myself for having ordered from them."
3	neg	train	"This is a neighborhood restaurant. The ingredients are always fresh and the food is tasty. I especially like the way they prepare crab. Don't forget to try the Fried ice cream (yes ""Fried""!!)"
3	neg	train	We went to this restaurant because friends had suggested it. The food was average, Our server was very good though. The atmosphere is a little lacking because they just play the local radio station(alot of commercials) and the lights in the cooking area are sooo bright. You could also hear everything the cooks were talking about and they talked alot! The prices were very reasonable but I'm not sure I would go back .
3	neg	train	The view out of their dining room window was Fantastic, but the food was mediocre at best. If you want a great view of the Amish Farmland this is the place for you! If you want a good breakfast,McDonald`s is better.The Family Cupboard`s biscuits were tough,the bacon was not crisp,the scrapple was nasty and the french toast sticks were burned!
3	neg	train	Really good food in a really fun atmosphere. It's a country style place just outside of Peoria. The service is a little slow, but any place that let's you throw peanuts on the floor earns extra points with me
2	neg	train	For a restaurant which carries the name of a world famous chef, Wolfgang Puck cafe is very mediocre. I have eaten there 3 times and have been disappointed each time. Their menu has what were once innovative items, but now are seen everywhere (chinese chicken salad, chopped salad, etc). I orderd the lunch special of a bbq chicken sandwich with a side of butternut squash soup. The soup was served room temperature, and once it was heated back up, was tasty. The sandwich seemed as if it had been sitting for hours - the melted cheese was stringy and cold, as was the chicken. My friend ordered the Chinois Chicken Salad, which had old chicken and limp lettuce. Honestly, I have had better food at mall food courts. I gave it 3 tries - but never again!!!
3	neg	train	I expected more out of this newly opened restaurant/bar formerly known as Brady's. The atmosphere was okay.. kind of empty and plain. However, I did not sit in the bar (smoking) section of the restaurant, which looked like it had more character. I ordered the O'Paddy which is basically a hamburger on rye. The seared rye bread was yummy, but I was really disgusted at how GREASY the food was! Along with the hamburger were french fries which were soggy and wet looking from all the grease! Overall, I won't go back again. I can get a better burger pretty much anywhere. For the health conscious, this place is a no-no. You don't even have to be a health finatic to be turned off by all of the grease.
3	neg	train	Sushi & all the Seafood are fresh, but the hot food & desert just ok. A half hour wait is not worth it. Price is little bit to high ($23.99 on weekend & holiday) for what we have. Parking is horrible.
1	neg	train	Meal was delivered cold and uncooked, bread served was old and stale, service was horrendous and the price was outrageous. When asked to speak to manager about the service and food, was not attended too. The worst experience I ever had, and it was on my Anniversary.
1	neg	train	Everyone was simply rude, almost like they did not want our business,,,food was ok but Way over priced for what you get. Service needs Serious work and education. Maybe if they are still around in a year we will go back and try it again
2	neg	train	This is the only Cajun/Creole restaurant on the shoreline. The food is good; the service is poor. The restaurant seemed to be understaffed. Our waitress had to take care of many tables. Moreover, she showed a distinct lack of familiarity with the menu and with server responsibilities. An appetizer had to be explained to her; she brought a beer with no glass to the table. Most importantly, it took much too long to be served. One person at our table had an appetizer. The salads that were served after it came 75 minutes after we'd sat down. A party of two that had arrived when we did had finished their meal and left before we were served our main courses. In any restaurant, the food can be excellent, but if the service suffers, it simply won't taste as good.
1	neg	train	I agree with the previous person that described their experience at this place. The wait staff was rude, there was never an entree suggested and we were never asked if how our food was once it arrived and had time to start eating. That is to just name a few things wrong with this establishment. Not real sure which Chardonnay the other person ate at that had nothing but good things to say about it. Kinda sounded like the owner of the Chardonnay leaving possitive input. There are plenty of great places to eat in Naples, stay clear of this one.
2	neg	train	"I'm never going to another Chevys again. This was one of the worst experiences of my life. Last night (August 22, 2003 at 6:00PM) we visited the Bar section of Chevy's. As usual my husband and I go to the bar and ask for a pair of margaritas. When we asking for them the bartender accused us of stealing money. With attitude she told us that 5 weeks ago we left the tab partially unpaid. She started ramping about the $5.12 we stole off them out of $32 tab. First of all why would we steal a partial tab being a regular in this place? Second being engineers we don't have the need to steal from anybody. First time we pay in cash the biggest mistake of our lives. Yes blame the Hispanics because no one else could of taken the money when we left it with the tab on the counter. Every time we've been there we've spent an average of 60 dollars plus with an average of 10 dollar in tip and this time we're the bad guys because it was the first time we pay in cash. The tab was small so why take out the credit card and because of that we go out as liars and a thieves. Then the manager comes and starts I a condescending tone ""anybody could have made a mistake"". Insinuating it was still our fault. My husband with two masters in engineering and mathematics and now all of the sudden he can't do simple math. We'll to make the story short we paid the $5.12 and had to pay our margaritas on the spot because they will not open a tab for us any more. If the initial attitude would have been polite and not a witch hunt (or Latino lynch), the story could have been different. I didn't have a problem paying the $5.12 that's not going to make us any poorer but the way they reacted was very humiliating and very unprofessional."
1	neg	train	The restaurant was noisy, not very clean but the service was Ok. I had the nachos for 6.99 and I received a plate with 7 nachos chips with small amout of meat (the meat was tough), beans and lots of cheese, lettuce tomato. I will not return.
1	neg	train	"This place has serious problems. 5 visits have gained it no favor. Their veal picatta looks disgusting and when I asked if it had changed on a subsequent visit the waiter told me he ""wouldn't eat it"". And the waiters, give me a break! I've never had good service here. Don't leave your tables unattended for long periods at a time!"
2	neg	train	Early dinner on Mother's Day. Drinks served incorrectly. Delay in ordering drinks, delay in ordering entrees. Two dishes were completely dried out and tough (both Chicken). A pasta dish was served (Alfredo) with a very bitter taste, I do know alfredo and this was awful. Almost non-existant service, and sub standard food. Wine was good but over priced.
3	neg	train	I had a great time. Partly due to the service. The waiters were very attentive and considerate to each member of a business dinner I recently attended there. The food was great; a little too traditional for my taste, but still very good!
3	neg	train	It was a birthday celebration. Lunchtime. The cook had no personability like the advertisement presents. The food was very bland. Not enough food. It was 3 in my party. We were all very unhappy and not satisfied with the service . We had taken time off from work and very disappointed.
2	neg	train	Fun and unique restaurant but the food is pretty bad (unless you consider Taco Bell gourmet). I'd go back for the entertainment value only but will bring some Pepto for the ride home.
1	neg	train	"We arrived at the restaurant and had to wait to be seated for 15 minutes, the server and the hostess saw us but refused to acknowledge us. When I approached the server to inquire about seating ourselves her curtly informed me that we had to wait, and here proceeded to seat the couple that came in behind us. When we were finally seated he took our drink orders, brought us the wrong drinks, and never came back to the table. We sat there for 30 minutes and watched them service people who had just come in. When we inquired about the situation we were told and I quote ""What difference does it make we would probably stiff them anyways."""
3	neg	train	Hoovers has the ability to be so much more than it turned out to be. When it opened, the portions were large and well worth the money. Take out was always my preference as there exists maybe only one truly good waitperson. Service is ALWAYS horribly slow, and on my last visit, I found that the portions are now smaller, pre-made salads look and take as their name imply, bathrooms are very dirty and locks on doors rarely work. I think that given some color (as in paint), and training to the wait people, Hoover's could be as good as Hoover himself intended to be. As a neighborhood place, and within walking distance, I would visit again if some much needed changes took place.
2	neg	train	The food was nothing to rave about - it was very mediocre. The chicken coating was tasty, however, the chicken breast I had was dry and tasteless. The waffle was okay, but it arrived cold. The service was non-existant. Our waitress came to our table twice - once to take our order, and then to give us our food, which we had to wait at least 20-25 min. to arrive.
2	neg	train	"Service was slow at best, Hostess was rude and when told we needed to get home for the new years and wouldn't be staying for dessert commented in a very callous tone "" Well I am sorry about that, that is how I make my living !"""
2	neg	train	Not a great pizza at all. It's what's around it. Lighthouse is part of Hidden Cove which is an entertainment complex. Most of the business comes from birthday parties and other functions that happen here. Send the kids downstairs to play games and stay upstairs and enjoy some so-so pizza.
1	neg	train	I judge a buffet by it's salad bar. this one sux ..... old country buffet is better salad .... beef tip were blood raw...ribs and chop were ever over cooked.. ONLY good thing were the giant king crab legs
3	neg	train	"We had good expectations after reading good cuisine review in the Palo Alto Weekly News. The after taste this experience left was so-so: 1) the good things: the ""Steak Frites"" (a good piece of beef steak with pepper sauce and french fries) was really good. The aperitif (Kir served with oiled olivas) was also a happy moment. Bread and butter were welcome. 2) The not-so-good things: the side-dish salad dressing was terrible - just a bit of tasteless oil. My wife's crepe (beef crepe with white sauce) will be quickly forgotten... The service was too slow and lacked assurance: the waiter looked almost scared to serve us: was it my haircut??? We had to ask twice for a small spoon! Had to ask twice for the Beaujolais as well. So I am not sure we'll go again - maybe just for a steak-frites with a glass of water!"
2	neg	train	The prices were too high for the small portions. The veal was very tough. One piece was so stringy I had to spit it out. The linguini was decent though.
3	neg	train	Dining recently at Blue Muse was a better experience than in the many times I'd dined there previously. For some time this place had major cooking problems, resulting in burned items, general lack of care in cooking and serving of food.
1	neg	train	"The employees seemed far more concerned with their own social agendas than in the business of the restaurant. We were ignored for 15 minutes till we finally decided against spending our money where we were unwanted. On our way out the host apologized with a lame. ""oh Sorry."" But there was no management intervention or attempt to save our business. The food smelled good and it appeared to be a delightful destination to sit and enjoy cocktails etc. Unfortunately for us the staff just couldn't be bothered with offering us beverages or anything for that matter so we left and will never go back. There are too many good restaurants like Kincaids down there where they do give good service."
2	neg	train	"The Irish Times was once a great place to go and socialize. The owners 5 year lease expired, the new management hired their ""friends"" and drove out the dedicated original employees - The menue has been culled from the original, eliminating several great items, their lack of cash makes it questionable as to the freshness of their food (They cant even stock simple beers in quantity anymore due to a CASH ONLY/Poor Credit situation with the liquor distributor) They ran it into the ground and have since filed chapter 11!!! When the management & employees change for the positive we all might revisit the ""Times"""
3	neg	train	Great location downtown, but service can be slow and the food is basically pub food. Great for a night out drinking, but not for a good meal. It would make a good lunch spot if you happen to be there on a day where they're moving quickly
2	neg	train	We are of Italian origin and thought that it would be nice to go to an Italian restaurant. we come from Montreal and in our city there is no problem to order food in an Italian restaurant and it tastes like home. so we ordered very simple antipasto. it was absolutely awful. The veggies were pickled with much too much vinegar like the ones you buy in the grocery store shelves and we ordered 3 antipastos for 3 people. they showed up with 1 plate for 3 people of this awful stuff with just a bit of salami on the top of these veggies , the chunks of cheese had a sour taste, and this plate was definitely not enough for 3 people and charged us a very unfair price of 18 dollars for this dish that was not even worth 5 dollars. We were nice and just paid and walked out of there never to step foot in there again when we visit again. maybe they make their other food better but they cannot make an antipasto, and for the other 2 people in this group, the very simple cold cuts sandwiches were below average too. Thank you
3	neg	train	Not much choice in Brimfield other than Pub's. This one gets the job done. A great value meal and friendly atmosphere.
3	neg	train	"Louie's is a small independent pizzeria that has been in business since 1960.They offer an ""All You Can Eat"" pizza,pasta and salad buffet for $5.95 on weekdays.While the food is not terrible,it is certainly not up to the standards that one would expect from a family owned and operated restaurant.The ziti was overcooked,the meatballs were canned,the salad was pulverized,the pizza was soggy and,most importantly,the tomato sauce was bland and appeared to be commercially produced.For $5.95 it is not a totally bad meal,but one could do much better in the Wallingford area."
3	neg	train	Not bad, but not the best mexican in town. They specialize in tamales, which they do better than anyone that I've had here, but there's no restuarant...it's just a take out place.
2	neg	train	Let me begin by stating that last fall my wife and I tried the $11.99 dinner buffet at the Union Buffet on a Friday evening and we were greatly impressed with how fresh,delicious and well prepared most of the offerings were.Yesterday ,after checking out the new Target store in Bethel,we tried the Union Buffet's lunch buffet and,sadly,found it to be one of the worst meals that we have ever had.All of the various meats used,including the chicken,beef and pork were tough and stringy.They were obviously of inferior grade and we found it hard to believe that we were in the same restaurant.The difference was like night and day.We didn't expect to find prime rib and pork loin on a $6.49 lunch buffet,but we also didn't expect the meat to be nearly inedible!The General's Chicken was fairly good,but nearly everything else,including the eggrolls and spring rolls,were downright nasty.I actually found bone fragments inside of 2 separate egg rolls! They have a grill which invites one to choose their favorite ingredients and then tell the chef which spices one would like them to be freshly prepared with.The grill chef was busy making sushi and was unavailable to be told which spices we preferred.We were told to just leave our selections and he would get to them later. Due to this we were unable to choose the spices that we preferred and he then just grilled our meats and vegetables with no seasonings whatsoever!We were highly unsatisfied by this experience.We may try their dinner buffet again,but after this we will never again have lunch here!
1	neg	train	We reserved their main table in the window for our anniversary. When we got there they said that was reserved by someone else and sat us in the back. The rear seating has all the atmosphere of a high school cafeteria. There were only 3 other couples and it became clear to us, that they had given the front table we requested to friends of theirs. The food was second rate. The seabass I ordered had been steamed beyond recognition. When my wife ordered a glass of wine, the glass itself was filthy. To top off a perfect evening, my credit card was stolen from my jacket, which was inside their locked cloakroom. I would never go to Pallucci's again nor would I ever reccomend it to anyone I liked.
3	neg	train	The wine was bland, the mushroom ravioli was delicious! The service was pretty good, considering there were a number of little kids at other tables to deal with. The food was a bit overpriced I thought. We just stopped in for some pasta and a glass of wine and spent over fifty dollars! But the food was nice and the atmosphere is really kind of cute. Its a good choice for a nice dinner in an otherwise lacking-good-Italian-food sort of neighborhood.
2	neg	train	it was dirty, the the lettuce was burnt (yes, burnt) and the chicken wings were so dry you could use them for kindling. but this isn't really my problem. i was eating these chicken wings and there was a feather on the last one!!
2	neg	train	The waiter was rude but the food tasted great as soon as the order was brought to the table as ordered.
2	neg	train	"We visited this Ponderosa location way back in early November of 2004 on our way home from a trip to Pennsylvania. I have held back on doing this review due to the fact that my wife and I were so dissatisfied with our dining experience here that we actually filed a complaint with the Ponderosa Corporation about this restaurant. It took until near Valentine's day of 2005 for our complaint to be handled to our satisfaction. I must be fair by stating here that this Ponderosa is in the middle of training a new management team and it seems that our complaint somehow ""slipped through the cracks"". Basically, We were dissatisfied on our visit for two reasons. First of all,the food was terrible! Our medium rare steaks were as tough as the proverbial shoe leather and pretty much everything on their salad bar was either wilted or in some way seemed to lack freshness. Our second issue was our waitress. Once she brought us our initial drinks and our meals she totally ignored us. We had to ask another waitress for drink refills as our waitress actually appeared to be ""hitting on"" another one of her customers. Good food and good service are, after all, the two main things that one looks forward to when dining out. With the assistance of John Anderson from the Ponderosa Corporation we finally were sent a $20.- gift card by Chris, this restaurants new manager,to make up for our bad experience. We ended up using our gift card last Saturday at Ponderosa's last surviving Connecticut location in Southington. As you will see from our review, the Southington, Ct Ponderosa provided us with a much mpre pleasurable dining experience. Someday,if we are in the Middletown, NY area again, we may stop in to see if new management has helped this location."
2	neg	train	They charged my credit card 20.00 over what I had put down on my receipt. I called them as soon as I saw this on my statement and they questioned me how I knew this and told me that they can't do anything about it and I have to wait to talk to a manager. it has almost been a week and a manager hasn't been in so I can get my money back. the food was really good but it wasn't worth getting ripped off.
1	neg	train	Our food was not cooked properly,it was cold and our waiter was extremely rude. It was my first time there and i am not satisfied with the food or service.
2	neg	train	"Well I called and made a reservation for 9:00 on a Wednesday night in June..I was told by the woman who answered that it wasn't necessary, but just to be safe I made one anyway. We arrived at 10 to 9 and were told we had to wait a few minutes so we sat at the bar and ordered a round of drinks. About 25 minutes and another round of drinks later we were seated.( Prepare yourself...the drinks were very expensive our bill was 60.00 just for the bar portion!)As we were seated the dining room wasn't as busy as we expected having waited for as long as we did.We were famished and since we didn't need drinks (still had the second round) we asked our server to bring us bread while we made our dinner selections . He said he would be right back.......15 minutes later...he returned to take our order but forgot to bring the bread! Ok everyone makes mistakes...even when they're not busy. He could have easily been a part of the calamity transpiring in the kitchen....it was very unprofessional..very Jerry Springer-ish. We should have walked out but at 10:45 we were sort of stuck...most restaurants close at 10...so we reluctantly stayed. On a more positive note the food was decent....better than we expected. The price ,however, was a shock. My husband ordered a veal dish and asked if the excess sauce could substitute the standard bland marinara atop the included side of linguini....our waiter said it would not be a problem ""It is a common request that we are happy to substitute"" were his words.So the rest of us requested the same sauce to be on our linguiniI. The dinner was good and we forgot the earlier part of the evening . Then the bill came.. after scrutinizing it we were shocked to see that this common request was expensive ,to say the least! $8.00 for each side of free linguini... the sauce that most chefs have excess of left in the pan and discard .Unbelieveable and inconceivable...$32.00 extra for something we were lead to believe to be included. Our waiter misguided us. Very dissapointing.When we tried to dispute this to our waiter..he sent us to the cashier...who was an owner. When we disputed this ,,she acted as if she didn't understand the charge, told our server to request an explanation from the kitchen,,,,after we waited 25 minutes, we were told that the chef was too busy to explain his charges. So we were left standing there with a blank look from the cashier and the snooty barmaid....with no other explanation other than that we should pay our bill and go on our way!.We were even approached by a burly man from the kitchen who threatened us .I was furious and felt cheated. Although the food was decent...the attitude and overall customer service level was lousy and very unprofessional."
1	neg	train	I found the flatwhare was not washed and food was either cold or burnt or both then they tried to hide it by covering it up and passing it off to my guest's and me, when pointing the problem out the ownners rather then trying to make it right (fixing it) try'd to make me out as a troublemaker so it will be a long day in somewere before I'll go there or recomened it to anybody else. It seems they can't keep any quailty cook's there.
1	neg	train	My wife and I were so looking forward to going to one Emeril Lagasse's place's but we ended up so disapointed. She ordered a steak that you could bounce of the floor,the food was cold , the service, let me rephrase that, what service?? our after dinner drinks were not up to standard.
1	neg	train	I am tempted to begin: some of my best friends are Japanese. And this much is true. What can one say for another no atmosphere Asian restraint in Vienna. That the food should be great, not just good for starters. The price to value ration should appeal, when the ambience does not. I can't think of an excuse for this place, except that the owners probably missed the boat, and the point, and one wonders when they'll notice few customers. But Asian restaurants have a way of hanging in there don't they? Low labor costs I suppose, postpone the day of reckoning. Just down the block from my home away from Poipu Beach on Kauai, in the old Empire city of Vienna, this latest edition won't see me again soon. After an afternoon run with a friend in the nearby Belvedere Palace grounds we stopped in for noodles. Belvedere Palace was built to say thanks to the Prince who stopped the Moguls from crossing the Danube and imposing noodles and such centuries earlier on the Viennese. We need the Prince back, I think, as a functionary of the Chamber of Commerce to explain to these Japanese owners, they too should withdraw. Or at least re-think this sterile excursion into overpriced Asian food. We had an appetite after the run, a very windy April day. Belvedere lies just outside the first district of Vienna on a slowly rising hill, with formal gardens with a scope most cities consider to be a park in itself. The palace itself is now used as a museum, but still has its grand salons, the largest of which saw the release of Austria by the Russian occupying powers in 1955. With our Belvedere generated interested in calorie in-take, we examined the menu for tasty low-fat combinations. I took the charming waitresses recommendation to have the Ramen Set. Preceded by four pot stickers and a bowl of white steamed rice, the main course of unimaginative vegetables in warm broth, all for Euro 9.80 without drink, did not satisfy my hunger or my lust for a good deal. My running companion choose much more wisely, a Ramen plate that included some scrumptious looking fried rice with vegetables, got him miso soup, tea, some badly fried chicken and vegetables. The sterility of the place looking in from the street would never have attracted me but for my friend's recommendation we take in some noodles. On the obvious utilitarian category this place aspires, it's a dismiss.
3	neg	train	Reservations?? Ha! What a joke. We were required to make reservations, for which we had to wait about 10 minutes for our table. Deciding they were a new restaurant, we gave them the benefit of the doubt. The food was wonderful, so we made reservations again for a party of 8 for a special occasion. Informed about 5 days out that the restaurant had cancelled our reservations in favor of a large party. Said it was tough luck on our part, but maybe we could try another place. Large function in town. All other fine dining restaurants completely booked for the date we wanted, and cannot travel far b/c of timing to arrive at event. Owner/ Manager took reservations personally and then said she had no idea who took the reservations. Very bad organization. We have out of town guests coming for our event, and we now have no place to eat other than fast food. We are local to Beaufort. I have spoken to other locals who have been treated similarly. If they don't treat their local return customers with any sort of kindness, please don't expect much if you are visiting Beaufort.
1	neg	train	"Very poor service from the moment of being greeted at the podium. The waiter had no concept of timing. Food was brought out and served incorrectly to all of 3 guests...this happened twice. Duck was sent back as it was undercooked....came back pretty much the same. The manager leaned over the table to set it in front of me. There was no silverware present, but this was not noticed., I had to ask for new silverware, as I thought that using my hands was inappropriate. Side dish was forgotten and arrived as the meal was literally over. The waiter never returned to replenish wine...we did it ourselves. I went to complain to the manager prior to dessert. He seemed totally shocked, offered no apologies and never came near us again.....the old concept of "" if you avoid the problem, it will go away"". He stood there shaking with no clue as to how to handle a dissatisfied guest. Well, we did go away, never to return. Not a soul to say good bye or thank you as you leave, having spent close to 250 dollars for 3. Dismal is the only way to describe it. Too mnay other choices in the city...who needs attitude !!!"
3	neg	train	This location is right next to my office. So we went in a little earlier than the lunch crowd, barely have to wait. Being at the Todai in Cupertino before, headed straight for the fresh sushi, also grabbed a few different kinds of salad, but the cooked clear noodle with mushroom salad was slightly spoiled. When the waitress came over to see how we were doing, I kindly mentioned it to her. She just mumbled something I couldn't understand and left. I only had 2 bites, it was too late, I had a slight stomache. Lines are too long at the hot food because of the lobsters, can't wait a long time to get food because it's my lunch hour.
3	neg	train	Food was really good. Really doesn't stand out as a must-eat place, but it's nice if your on Bradley's campus
1	neg	train	"I would have to give Sunset Restaurant Overall rating ""Zero""....Food quality, service & Restaurant atmospere was more than unsatsfactory. Unfriendly service....rude and disrepectful remarks made by manager while dealing with the service/food quality issues. The manager said that ""they have been in business over 43 years"" and told we were the only customers complaining about their restaurant. According to the manager, he owns part of ""Sunset Restaurant"" business. He abruptly came and took our food off the table and told us ""We do not appreciate your business....It is not your conern how our business should be operated"" and told us ""not to ever...ever...come"" to their restaurant again. Importantly....There is a health conerns that I should address to the public. We find a dirt/dead bug in Steamed mussels & steamed clams in our appetizer. How did we deal with the problem? We politely asked for the refund for the portion of our appetizer and the manager refused to do so. Should I contact Local Health Department about this problem? I don't it is worth my time and effort to correct the problem....notifying the local health department. Sunset Restaurant should be just put out of business....They should know it better.....From my experience at Sunset restaurant, I will not visit there again. Customers ""PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU SCRUTINIZE YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU CONSUME!!"" It was very foolish of this manager at Sunset Restaurant treated its customers in very bad manner. He doesn't understand the power of his customers. He should simply take classes in ""Dummies for Principles of Management""."
1	neg	train	Review deleted due to Posting Policy violation.
3	neg	train	For the most part the food was tasty. They had some creative dishes such as the Mexican Lasagna. The ground beef they use in tacos is a little on the bland side. Overall a decent experience.
1	neg	train	My guests and I were horribly embarassed by a manager who refused to accept the fact that a dish had been over salted in the kitchen, insisting that there was nothing wrong with the food and that the problem must therefore lie with us. His insulting, condescending behavior was totally unacceptable. Considering the fact that the rest of our dining experience was completely unremarkable, we intend never to return, and recommend that you don't, either.
3	neg	train	This is a great restaurant to eat at when it is not busy. I have been there when it has been very busy and the customer service goes down along with their hospitality. Also, on busy nights it gets so loud it's hard to carry a conversation. They do, however, have really great food. The portions are always more than you would expect and they have a variety of things on the menu. Go there during the week and you should have a pleasant experience.
2	neg	train	"Overrated, overhyped - good for people who want quantity over quality. I have eaten at the Cheesecake Factory in Brentwood and Marina Del Rey and they both were far better than this one. The barbecue chicken salad had very little chicken and practically no barbecue sauce or flavor. The ""crisp"" onion strings were soggy and cold and tasteless. The iced tea is great."
1	neg	train	"I felt like I was back in my elementary school cafeteria, the smell in the air initiated my reluctance, and then we were served by a waitress who reminded me of ""Mel's Diner"", and then there was the food...ugh, also reminiscent of cafeteria style 'mystery food'. I left with a lost appetite and great apologies to my out of town friends who were equally dissatisfied."
3	neg	train	Located inside the Embassy Suites hotel but if your pinched for time or to tired to ventured out this is a good option. Large appitizzer menu (don't miss the blue crabs) and frsh fish on the menu. Staff is attentive since it is not a high volume location.
3	neg	train	"Great service, decent food. Restaurant is now buying its own gift certificates on Ebay and sending nasty notes to unsuccessful bidders saying ""you have to pay real money for these"". Bad PR, guys!!"
2	neg	train	Too expensive, food not prepared very good, service was very poor
3	neg	train	I eat at this restaurant whenever possible when traveling, since I do not have one in my home town. Food is Great! Service usually likewise. Lots of food, good price. Had a customer service problem that I did not feel was addressed properly after talking to manager the following day. Went to feedback section TWICE and explained problem, asking for explanation or call. This was early June. Who is reading the feedback!!!!???
1	neg	train	Sad to say that this place CLOSED. The building and sign are still there but no people in there.
3	neg	train	Just another restaurant serving the same menu as everyone else. Not saying it's a bad place, but I like a little more variety than the same omelet and bacon platter that is served at most restaurants for breaksfast.
2	neg	train	My boyfriend and I went to Rum Jungle as a restaurant. It also turns into a night club at night. We found the prices to be quite expensive compared to other casino restaurants. The food was enjoyable but nothing more than average. The atmosphere was quite neat with the running water and flames. A very dark restaurant. The service stunk! First they brought out my meal and we thought they were going to go back and get my boyfriends. So we sat there waiting and the service finally came around and asked if something was wrong, why wasn't I eating. I asked where my boyfriend's meal was and they said it wouldn't be ready for another five minutes or so. I had to ask them to take my meal back until his was also ready! Who serves one meal but not the other?! It was hard getting our drinks re-filled. It was hard flagging down someone when we needed a condiment or even the check. We won't return.
3	neg	train	Again, nothing wrong with this place, but nothing special either. It seemed a little pricey and it's just another chain serving the same food as everywhere else.
2	neg	train	I have to say that the food was WONDERFUL... but our server was awful. Despite the poor service, we still left her a nice cash tip. For some reason, she took it upon herself to add an extra $26 tip to our credit card after we crossed out the tip part and totaled it up. It was probably illegal for her to do that with a party of three, and definitely unethical, but dining travelers in Orlando probably don't always save their receipts and check their statements. The restaurant unapologetically said it will refund us, but five days later, we still haven't seen it. Enjoy the food, but if you go here, watch your credit card statement!
1	neg	train	I'm into cheap eats, but even tv dinners would be a step up from what my girlfriend and I were served there. The chicken satay was unseasoned, and peanut dipping sauce was gelatinous from cornstarch. And the noodles were soggy and accented with dishwashing detergent. Enter at your own risk.
1	neg	train	Me and my girlfriend went to Lamotte's one evening looking for a pleasant dinner. It was about 7 pm. We were the only table and we requested the pattio area that our friends suggested. They told us that the pattio area was closed, but about 20 minutes after we got there, we saw our server take a group of 5 back to this pattio area. Our waitress seemed to give us an attitude whenever we asked for something. Our tabled cloth was very wrinkley, and somewhat damp. I ordered a steak medium rare, and it came out well done. My wife ordered chicken alfredo, and it looked like soup. A large man was constantly walking around the restauraunt and starrign at us, making us feel most uncomfortable being that we were the only table in our section. When I asked to speak to a manager, it took about 20 minutes for him to come see me. And what really made me angry, was that after enduring all that suffering, all he offered me and my wife was a slice of pie... A SLICE OF PIE!!! Well we took it none the less. We reccomend this restaurant to NO ONE! Stay away from this awful place.
1	neg	train	service was horrible, very smokey bar too loud to be able to enjoy a romantic dinner, poor drinks
2	neg	train	The food was good but I could tell it was already cooked beforehand. The mashed potatoes were watered down.
1	neg	train	I went to the Mitchellville location for the second time on Saturday, June 24 because my first visit in April, 2004 was a pleasant one. What a mistake! The place was crowded and understaffed, and no one appeared to be in charge. The wait times to order were excessively long, and the young woman at the counter was extremely rude. When my order was finally ready, I had to ask her several times to please get it. At first, she ignored me and disappeared into the back room for 10 minutes, while the other counter people paid me no mind. When she returned, I had to to get belligerent to get her to notice me and give me my order. She literally threw it at me. The meal wasn't even worth it. After all that trouble, the entree - fried trout - was a collection of greasy, overcooked scraps. I'll never go back.
1	neg	train	The boss is very unfair. He overcharged and refused to return the amount. VERY poor businessman!
3	neg	train	It took 10 mins to get waited on and then whenever we asked our server for something he had someone else bring the item. It took our server several minutes to get anything done.
1	neg	train	Not a pleasant experience the atmosphere is overrated I could get better food at Perkins. I was extremely dissapointed.
1	neg	train	They tried to make room for our party of 25; however, they seated us on one side of the building that did not work. The waiters had no room to serve us. So they stood at the end of the table and pass the food down. Of course several orders were wrong, for intant overcook, undercook, not order just a few mistakes that took place. We clean off the tables ourselves and got our own to go boxes. Needless to say the majority of us were really disappionted and vow to never to return. I beleive that you may be able to convince us otherwise.
1	neg	train	"A big fanfare preceded the opening including the big deal about using Fen Shui in the layout. A couple of days after the opening (September 13, 02) my wife and I visited the restaurant. For apetizer we had Peking dumplings which were ok. Then, my wife ordered Kung Pao chicken and I ordered Szechuan beef. Both of the dishes were dry and tasteless, but the worse part was that, after a couple of bites, I found a 3 inch wire in my dish! We called the manager, who first just stood there for a moment, and then she said: ""We will not charge you for it"", and left in a rush. I did not eat the rest of my dish, and my wife reluctantly finished hers. Not only was a disgusting and dangerous experience, but the manager's reaction was wrong and nonchalant to say the least. Respectful, concerned, and capable managers would not only give you a new dish, but would not charge you for the whole meal. Incidentally, the table was so small that even the small portions we were given did not quite fit in the table! We have visited many chinese restaurants all over the States and Europe, and never had such an unpleasant experience: lousy table, lousy food and lousy management. l & Diana Bolanos"
2	neg	train	I went to dinner last night 03/08/05 at Anthony's Restaurant in Richland Washington. The dinner was terrible. I ordered an Alaskan Halibut. It tasted like it was not done. The sauce was runny and tasted awful. The broccoli was so hard that I could not cut it with a knife. When I tried to cut the broccoli, it squirted sauce all over my face and table. I had to ask for another drink while my dinner was being cooked because the waitress never came by to ask us how we were doing. They forgot to give my husband and I our clam chowder. I told the waitress that we did not want to be charged for the clam chowder because they forgot to give it to us. She gave it to us in a container to take home. This was my first and going to be last visit to the Anthony's in Richland Washington unless I hear that they have improved there service and food. I grew up in Richland Washington and know alot of people since I work for Fluor Hanford and will tell them what I think if they ask. I have talked to alot of employees that I work with and they said that the restaurant is very expensive and the food is not good at all. I know now....... My husband and I paid for our bill of $75.00 dinner and gave the waitress a 10.00 tip. Money is not an issue for my husband and I. We like to go to a nice place for dinner and get good food and good service if you can understand. Thank You for allowing me to vent..... I can say one thing, the view was great...
1	neg	train	After living in Culver City and frequenting this establishment regularly, it was my sad experience to return after several years. The service was terrible, the waiter surly and the manager worse! Not only was she not helpful, but absolutely insulting. To finish a truly horrible experience the food...terrible, the steaks, the pasta, the childrens menu items. After all these years, perhaps it is time to close the doors. THE BOTTOM LINE: Don't Go!!!
3	neg	train	La Tasca is a warm and friendly place that sells cheap, yet filling tapas. I was there on a hot date when - would you hot shot city it - David Hasselhoff nonchalantly strolled in! After that, the delicious, buttery and perfectly garlicked circles of chorizo sausage started to turn into David's aquiline profile. I couldn't concentrate on the food after that! I just thought this was a great experience I should share with you all. Everyone should meet David Hasselhoff at least once in their lives, and what better place than in a tapas bar. GREAT.
3	neg	train	Enjoyable pub/Rest. with a surprising number of seafood offerings. Friendly atmosphere makes it family friendly. The specilas are from the local waters. You can't go wrong by ordering the catch of the day broiled.
2	neg	train	I also ate there, separately, at the same time as Stan (whom I met after when we played a fun round of golf), and my experience was the same. The service was very slow (surprising, given that it was a Saturday morning when alot of golfers are milling about), and the table cloth could have been cleaner. However, I had the scrambled eggs and potatoes, which were excellent. Also, the menu says it is two eggs, but mine had about three; and the potatoes are among the best I've had. Finally, for under $5 the simple eggs/potatoes/toast breakfast standard was a good value. They just need to brush up on service.
1	neg	train	I not only ate there but I also worked there. It was a one man show that was impossible to work with. The new manager Francis waits on all the tables, while all the other waitresses are made in to bus girls and food runners for him. Do not expect good service.
2	neg	train	If you want a drink,and not have conversation, it's fine! Dining - move on, my friend. Passe fusion menu and very overpriced. The entertainment was fine, but the room's acoustics overpower EVERYTHING.
3	neg	train	"Located in a beautiful downtown setting, this Italian restaurant is a wonderful local favorite. Arranged along one wall are several serving counters. Customers can walk up and order from a huge variety of choices. There are dozens of varieties of pizza, including BBQ chicken, Potato and Bacon, Eggplant and Roasted Peppers, along with Pepperoni and, of course, Cheese. At the salad counter, you can choose your ingredients from mushrooms, spinach, pasta, shrimp, turkey, etc. and the chef will toss it freshly for you, with balsamic vinegar, spices, virgin olive oil, and parmesan cheese if you desire. Hot entrees are available, including Eggplant Parmesan, Penne, Chicken Marsala, Ziti and Gnocchi. The Marinara sauce is world-class! Try the incredible oven-roasted vegetables as a side dish. Sandwiches include steaks, meatballs, peppers and eggs, and even hamburgers. A special favorite is the made-to-order Pasta Fagioli soup. After ordering your food, you can take it ""to go"" or eat in the comfortable, bright dining room. Fantastic food and excellent value; a perfect choice for lunch or a family dinner. Outside dining deck in rear, complete with tables and umbrellas in season. No liquor license."
3	neg	train	"Place is mostly carry-out and delivery. They have signs claiming their dining room is open, but I couldn't tell where. The food is your basic pizzeria style food. They're claiming ""Chicago Style Pizza"", but I never saw one being made...all I saw where thin crusts. There's a variety of sandwiches. The prices are the only thing really good about this place. I had a pretty good meal for just under $4.00. Definately better pizza places in town, but it's not bad if your looking for something different."
1	neg	train	I took my sister to Rain Forest Cafe. When I went there this summer, they had four vegetarian options on a small menu. I was expecting to have The Plant Sandwich, a large pile of grilled vegetables on bread. I even told my sister that it was too large for one person to eat. I talked this place up. When I got there, the Plant Sandwich was gone. The menu only had one veggie option left, a patty of brown rice on bread. I'd rather eat sand. The manager said that they could make us vegetarian food to order. That isn't the point. I want it on the menu. I want people who would normally order meat think about helping the rainforest by eating plant-based food for a change. I am very angry!!! I was expecting to give my sick sister a treat. I am feel like they threw hot coals in my face!
2	neg	train	I understand that this is a buffet, but come on, there's gotta be a better way to keep your food looking a little better, that's the employees' job in the first place! Some of the food was dried to the bone or you just knew by looking at it that it had been sitting there for hours... The only thing I did not complain about is the dessert aisle, it was the best place in the restaurant! I just think that the rest of the place needs a little more work. And it would help to at least smile a little or be just a tad more courteous when you are the Dining attendant--hey, you want better tips don't you?? I just advise anyone who goes there regularly or have never been there to think about the value you're really getting for all that money you spend.
1	neg	train	Bad food. Terrible pad thai. My roommate felt ill afterwards. And the delivery was glacially slow. Worse food than the other New Haven staples and not any cheaper.
3	neg	train	Good spot for a cold beer, burger, fried appetizers and fun with friends. This is a large sports bar with a typical sports bar menu-- Florida Style. Conch Chowder, fish platters, oysters are key menu items.
3	neg	train	Enjoyed it very much as they have so much to offer in heart healthy menu items, only concerns - failed health inspections several times, noise level is intolerable. a food service worker told me of the failures and said she would never eat there so I'm in a quandary. I like the food, but the noise and now the questionable health failures worry me.
1	neg	train	"We moved to Germantown from another state. While this place is conveniently located in the 'burb, there is nothing to be enthusiastic about here-other than the god-awful high prices in re the ""quality"" lol, lol. Memphis plainly doesn't ""eat well"", or the locals are fooled into thinking that Equestria is upscale food. Ordering a grilled steak is not ""upscale dining"" in my book. You can get a fairly decent steak at Outback ! Why go out to an upscale place to order ""chicken"" for example? This place is below average but probably ranked ""above average"" by locals, simply because they don't know any better (no offense) ! If you're used to chain food, burgers, awful cheap or fatty Mexican and Chinese, well this place might impress you. It's insulting to anyone's living experiences to suggest this place is even anywhere close to SanFran, NYC, Miami, ATL, or even NASHVILLE or Charlotte !"
3	neg	train	As a chain, it's fine, but there's really nothing special about the food. You can go into any chain in any city and find the exact same food....only thing different here is the Austrailian Theme
1	neg	train	It was the most fantastic Chinese food I've ever had!! I had the tangerine shrimp and it was to die for!! I just wish they'd give out the recipe since I live about 200 miles away!! But the next time I get anywhere near there I'M GOING!!
1	neg	train	Room Service is a take out and delivery type of establishment. On 11/3 I ordered a salad from them to be delivered to my place of work. After I placed the order I even called back to make sure that I had ordered the Chef Salad w/Ranch and she told me yes and that it would be delivered between 12:00 and 12:30 and I waited until 12:30 and I finally called again and I was told the delivery person had the order. I never received the order and I sat at my desk hungry until 1:00 pm and I decided to call back and she told me that I never placed an order because she did not have a ticket for me. I work for a large organization and they do a great deal of business here and she told me that they did not have one order for where I worked for but several and she didn't have one for me. I asked her if she would have my order delivered because she was the one who messed it up and I was hungry. She told me no because they did not deliver after 1:00 p.m. She asked me did I want to speak to the manager and I said please, she returned to the phone and told me the manager could not talk to me or help me because there was not a ticket for me, which meant I hadn't placed an order. Why would I have to lie and why would I keep calling if I hadn't placed and order. I would like everyone at UMC to know how these people are because I am sure over 50% of their business comes from here. No one tried to rectify the situation by at least delivering me my salad or letting me come to pick it up and nobody cared whether I was diabetic or not or needed to eat at a certain time. I feel that these people are rude and doesn't deserve my business. Word of mouth is still the best form of advertisment.l
1	neg	train	The experience was a horror. The waitress was a very unpleasant snobby person..wonder what's wrong with these people, they are not nice at all! The owner better wake up!!!
3	neg	train	"This is a pleasant place to dine. When we came ""the tall skinny guy"" was kind and hospitable."
3	neg	train	Another country style restuarant on the outskirts of Peoria with good down home cooking.
1	neg	train	I thought the place tried very hard to be something it wasn't. It was like a taco stand trying to be 4 star.
1	neg	train	"Worst restaurant dining experience ever. The ""fresh"" salmon was still frozen in the center, soggy veggies and bland rice accompanied the frozen salmon. The service was abysmal - lack of attention and maturity of the staff was evident. A look into the kitchen makes one wonder if the owner is legit. Would NEVER return."
1	neg	train	"We started the meal with an order of several tapas and a decanter of sangria. After about half an hour, we called for a second decanter of sangria , and the opportunity to place an order for a second round of tapas. We were ignored by the very hurried staff for at least ten minutes, and finally a man who appeared to be the person in charge came and presented us with the check. He informed us that the restaurant was ""...not a cafeteria. You people are not spending enough money and we have a line of other customers, so you need to leave..."" When we could speak again, we complained to a waiter/busboy who came by our table about not having an opportunity to place another order. He said, ""you do not have to leave."" But after he left, the first man returned and continued to berate us for not having made it worth while to have seated us. He reiterated that the restaurant was not a cafeteria, and held fast to his demand that we leave. This, despite our explanation that we had not even been given the opportunity to place an order for more food and continue with our meal. To add insult to injury, we then had to wait an additional ten minutes for someone to bring us the change for our check. We were finally whisked out the front door, with waiters clearing the table before our coats were on. A thoroughly humiliating experience."
3	neg	train	A Vero Beach lanmark that specializes in seafood. Several types of fish are offered as the Catch of the day and can be prepared in a couple of ways. Most meals come with side options and a parfit for dessert. A lunch menu offers soup combos with salads and sands.
2	neg	train	This was our third attempt at this restaurant in hopes that at some point things would get better. Our first visit, we waited close to 20 min's before a server ever approached our table... They walked by a few times but never really stopped...I guess they thought that if they ignored us we would go away. This is the restaurant that sparked the idea of creating we8there.com this is a true story. Our second attempt was equally frustrating we were publicly scolded for opening a window to let some fresh air in at our table and not once did the server come back to check on our progress, The irony is that we left a tip only because they expected us to not leave a tip from the moment we entered the restaurant, not to mention the scowl on the greeters face as if to say what do you want. Our third and final attempt was our final straw, we were seated next to the server station, if we had been any closer and we would be sitting on the coffee burners. The restaurant was not very busy and there were other tables available. I asked the server if we could move to one of the tables next to the window with the excellent view of the Pacific Ocean, she told us that they were reserving those seats for parties of three or more however she agreed to move us to another two seat table. The only problem the new table was next to another server station, so we declined; to make matters worse we watched as three more couples arrived at the Sandpiper and were promptly seated at the table reserved for parties of three or more. And again our server failed to come back to check on us in fact we received our check almost immediately after we ordered as if we had no need to order anything else off the menu. I guess you are wondering how the food was. The truth is does it really matter, the service was so horrible so who cares! I have vowed that I will never eat at the Sandpiper Restaurant Bar and Grill ever again!
2	neg	train	I went for lunch with my wife and two young children on a rainy day. We were seated at a table with a water view, but when we sat down the ceiling began leaking on our table. The waitress was apologetic and moved us to a drier seat by a computer station. My family overheard from the nonstop gossip by the waitresses at this computer that rain in the building has been an ongoing complaint. Apparently the water not only comes from the ceiling, but also saturates the rug from under a back door. My two-year-old son tripped in this wet spot and soaked his knees and hands. With such a pricey menu you would think that management could afford to maintenance the building.
1	neg	train	Not sure why this place is so highly rated. We stumbled in from Eastern Market and regretted it almost immediately. The food was mediocre, the service was terrible (the hostesses stood around gossiping for about 5 minutes before noticing that we were waiting and seating us, then we waited forever to get our check, and again to get the receipt to sign), and worst of all this place is extremely overpriced. $8 for a small serving of so-so pancakes that don't come with anything?!? Please.
3	neg	train	It's was OK food. I don't think it is anything special. and the restaurant was little. The decore is the restaurant is a little cheap in decor.
1	neg	train	I had visit many other Todai's buffet before which included San Jose, Pleaston, Beverley Hill, and Hong Hong. But the Daly City one is so disappointed me, there was not enough food to choose from when I compared with other Todai's. The lines were always very long, need to wait more than 10-15mins to get the food that we wanted.
1	neg	train	"I had the most terrible dining experience at Sole. The portions were extremely tiny and the service was terrible. The bread server did not serve bread to every table and even when asked, he did not serve the bread until you asked twice. The sun-dried tomato paste to go with the bread was used by another group's table before it was given to us and when we asked for butter, we never got any. The dessert menu was thrown in my face and it took twenty minutes before dessert finally arrived. Finally, it took another twenty minutes until we got our check. We approached Sole's manager about the situation and he screamed at us telling us "" I will believe you if you tell me the food was bad or the service was bad! I don't believe the hostess threw your menus, she is a professional! I have 650 people to serve, so I don't have time!"" All we wanted was to alert the manager of the situation, but he did not want to hear any of it. When we left the restaurant, we noticed there were only five people waiting to get into the place. Clearly Sole is not worthy of any business. I would not patronize them ever again."
3	neg	train	Your pretty basic greek place. They serve the same gyros that most of the other greek places do. They also the regular American fare.....Italian Beef, hamburgers, hot dogs, french fries, etc. Service was really quick and that along with the decent food makes it a place to add to quick lunch spots.
2	neg	train	Tonno Rosso has a beautiful view of the bay, but that's where the good part ends. Prices are high for ho-hum appetizers and bland fish. Side dishes were over-salted but lacking any other flavor.
1	neg	train	I ordered the grilled prawns for lunch, and when they arrived, the stench was so overpowering it nearly knocked me out. The people at the table next to us were commenting on how surprised they were I would even be willing to try one bite. After one taste it was inedible- the smell was so fishy and offensive that the odor hung in the air. I discreetly explained to the server (who had the personality of a wet mop) that I was unable to eat them because of the smell and he wordlessly marched off in a huff with my plate. Two minutes later, a man arrived at our table with the offending prawns in hand, informed me loudly that there was nothing wrong with the prawns (he tasted them, he pointed out) and that I would still have to pay for them and disappeared immediately without even identifying himself or giving me a chance to speak. When the bill arrived, I asked to see the manager. The same combative man appeared back at the table and again argued with me and told me I had to pay for the meal even though I'd had no lunch.
2	neg	train	My experience was horrible. I was forced to be seated outside because the dark chubby old saggy man with dark bifocals was what I call racist. He charged two times more than what I was expected to pay. I confronted him and he said he didn't have time for bulls**t. I said I was going to file a complaint and he said I don't give a f@#%. Not only that I also choked on a ball of hair that was served to me in my lunch special. for a cup of ice for me was $3 that isn't anything but it was unfair because the lady across from me was asian and recieved it for free. This isn't the reason why I am giving a complaint I wasn't treated with respect and the people there were great but Mr. Bifocals he was unfair it wasn't because of the double charge it is because of his attitude I wouldn't have care if he had a great attitude towards me and if my food didn't have any hairballs, and if he didn't call me a wetback b*tch all I have to say is go to hell Mr. Bifocals
1	neg	train	"Terrible. We got there and there was no one to seat us, so we had to seat ourselves. They do not have many tables but have room for more. Maybe they don't do much business? Ok, well since this is a ""new"" restaurant, we will give them a little bit of the doubt. Took us 20 minutes just to get noticed - and another 10 just to get water. Another group came after we did and got served water and bread faster. Then, when we were finally acknowledged and our order taken, another 40 - 45 minutes until the food came. The chicken was not well cooked. It was half-cooked and the lemonade was like water - no lemonade but yet they charge you for lemonade and you get colored water. Then the chicken -- we sent our dinners back. Then the pizza. The pizza was also half-cooked. The tomato sauce was virtually raw. Horrible. We will never return and tell others it was the worst dining experience we had."
2	neg	train	The food was pleasant. The service was horrible. Our waitress took her time coming to wait on us, then disappeared. Getting a refill on coffee was impossible. When I asked another waitress she told me she wasn't my waitress and to wait for mine.
3	neg	train	A quick service deli that specializes in wraps and salads. Several varieties of wraps for all diets and tastes. Good spot for a quick lunch to avoid fast food burgers
1	neg	train	Dining at Bandera's runied our evening and put my friend in the hospital. My friend is alergic to nuts and was told that the desert didn't have any for sure. A few minutes after the arival of our desert we found out that there were nuts in the pie. My friend could hardly breath because it causes her throat to swell shut. She had to be rushed to the hospital and that's where us girls had to spend our evening. The manager was a total jerk about the whole situation. I would suggest to anyone and everyone never to dine there.
2	neg	train	My daughter, son-in-law, husband and myself decided to visit this restaurant while visiting on 1/1/05. First of all, we were seated at a booth which was too small to handle the four of us. The hostess should be more considerate when seating people and anticipate their seating needs. Once seated at a larger table, we placed our orders. Three of us ordered a extra salad not to replace the usual side item for the menu choice. Once we received our salads, I had to ask for croutons as none were on the salads. My son-in-law requested new utensils as his were dirty. The waiter never brought any more, we had to take some off another table. Once the food arrived, the side items were missing from the burgers, the waiter informed us that he had substituted the salads for the fries. After arguing with us over it, we insisted that the salads were extra orders for all of us. He brought out two orders of fries, no apology for the mix up. The food was decent and we then received our checks. Not to our surprise, the tickets were wrong. The waiter had charged us $3.99 each for the salads, instead of the $2.49 that was listed on the menu. Since so many things had occurred through-out the dining experience, we asked for a manager. After explaining all of our complaints, the manager not only removed the salad charges, but the beverages and gave us a 20% discount off of our bill. Needless to say, we will not visit this establishment again. We feel that it shouldn't be necessary to call on a manager to make our visit an enjoyable one. Our waiter was named Jason and we believe that Jason needs to be re-trained on how to serve his customers.
1	neg	train	"My experiance was that of disgust. My bartender looked like something straight out of a horror movie. Can you say ""urrggghhh"" , the midget manager was licking chicken off of his fingers , which made me really question the professionalism of this establishment , then to make matters worse my waitress Monica was wearing a shirt three sizes to big that looked like it wasnt washed for about 3 years. The food was disgusting and tasted like Mexican food and the service was even worse. If you have any type of brains you will cross this place off of your restaurants to go list."
3	neg	train	Another attempt at Chicago style food in Central IL. It's not horrible, but there's much better Chicago shops in and around the city.
1	neg	train	"I've read in many places, and so probably have you, that the Niagara Falls area is overpopulated by mediocre restaurants. Over two hundred restaurants and none (that I've been able to find) that are any good. Let me tell you about the latest restaurant rip-off in Niagara Falls, Ontario. It was my wife's birthday and we planned a weekend outing to some of the local wineries, a night at the Mariott Hotel at the falls, and a dinner out. We selected Casa Mia. We called them on a Saturday afternoon, looking for a reservation for that night. They didn't bother to take our name, they said that a couple can be accommodated at anytime. This, folks, is a bad sign. Where I come from, the best restaurants are booked up a week in advance. I called several establishments that night and found that none of them were booked up. We arrived at Casa Mia on time and were shown to our table in an almost empty dining room. Our waiter was excellent, too bad he is stuck in such an under performing place. The wine we chose was out of stock, but he suggest another which was excellent. It went downwards from there. My wife ordered a soup to start the meal, and although it sounded good (spinach Florentine), it arrived too cold to be of much use. My caeser salad had soggy croutons and was completely un-inspiring. We both ordered the same entree, a gnocchi pasta dish with a meat sauce, the ""pasta special"". Again the plates were stone cold and the contents were only just acceptably warm. The meat sauce was absent. After a couple of teas we were presented with a ninety dollar bill which was about twice what the night was worth. What a disappointment. At no time was the room more than half full, and on a Saturday night. If someone somewhere can tell me where a good meal can be found in Niagara Falls, Ontario, speak up."
1	neg	train	"If you want to go order, eat and leave this is the place for you. The food is good - not great but good. If you are like me - want to meet friends and have a few drinks and visit before ordering - then you need to go somewhere else. El Porton has one good waiter - the rest are very lazy and rude. Our latest waiter tried to give us our check twice before we were ready to order - in less then an hour and we got there at 4:30 - not exactly a dinner rush. He never cleared our table and when we needed anything we had to go hunt for him. This was not just one time - we have had problems there before. It is a central place in Little Rock for us to meet and the last 3 times we were lucky to have the ""ONE"" good waiter - so we thought things had changed. We were very wrong!!!! I might go back if I could make sure I had the good waiter otherwise there are many other good mexican places with much better service."
1	neg	train	The experience we had was very unpleasant. The waitress (blonde hair pulled back) was very rude and a snob, she flirted with my brother and his wife was very upset. The total night was ruined. She just kept flirting, staring and smiling at him. We were all very unconfortable and dissatisfied. Our advise to the owner is to get rid of her. We will never recommend this place
2	neg	train	Made a reservation but still had to wait 1 1/2 hrs to get a table. My husband did not get the kind of potato he ordered, told waitress and she never fixed the problem. Both our steaks were overdone. Waitress said she couldn't do anything about it.
1	neg	train	"Pop City has a game room, a dance club, a diner-style eatery, and an upscale restaurant-- all separate entities under the umbrella of Pop City. It is unbearably loud, even in the ""upscale"" restaurant due to big screen TV's and VERY loud music in the game room. First we went to the eatery and although not busy were not brought a menu for nearly 10 min. We ordered a diet coke and a water and looked over the menu. A moment later we realized this restaurant did not have a good selection and so we decided to leave. I saw that our waitress hadn't got our drinks yet so I politely told her that we had decided to go to the other restaurant as she had in fact suggested when she had visited our table. She said okay and we left. We were seated in the ""upscale"" restaurant and almost ten minutes later, lo and behold, our server FROM THE OTHER RESTAURANT comes over with our diet coke and water and says, ""that'll be 2.17."" Of all the nerve! She was obviously keeping the money since she didn't have to log anywhere that the drink was served to ANOTHER restaurant. Anyway, we waited another nearly twenty minutes for a server to come to our table and then nearly 45 minutes for our food. The food was decent but was absolutely NOT worth what was most likely the worst service I have ever encountered. My only regret is that I did not get the name of the so called waitress who brought us the drinks, it might have been nice at least to know she'd been fired."
3	neg	train	Overall, it was an excellent experience. The menu choices covered much more than steak. A large portion of the menu offers seafood, off-the-beaten-track appetizers. Our favorite was the fried green tomatoes, which were not from a food service. The steaks were excellent and cooked to perfection. I had a great side of mashed garlic cauliflower, a definitely pleasing change from the usual baked or other potato offerings. It's a great place with great people. Try it, you'll like it.
2	neg	train	The sashimi was not fresh at all, and had food poisoning that night, and had to attend a conference the next day. Do not go to any of the Todai restaurants.
1	neg	train	"The name is La Vecchia's...we went in and were immediately turned off by the ""warehouse"" type decor and atmosphere. The young staff was silly and inattentive. We were seated in row type seating- not conducive to privacy or conversation. Waiter walked up and smarted off for no reason - we just got up and walked out."
1	neg	train	My fellow colleagues and I went there for dinner and a few drinks. Although the food was ok, the service and management were appauling. We have never been so mistreated in our lives. The wait staff was pushy and rude, the management was dispicatble and the so called owner was useless. I would never recommend this place unless you want to be handed a $300 bill for being treated like yeaterday's trash.
3	neg	train	Part of a chain that is through out the Southeast. Built to cater to tourists. Many seafood options. Types of fish, preperations, suaces for toppings. A could seafood and crab buffet is also available. Staff is knowledgeable on the fish and menu. Several large fruitty cocktails highlight the drink menu. Don't miss the oyters Rockafeller. THey top them with crabmeat.
1	neg	train	"ONCE AGAIN!!!!! I have to warn the food consuming public about this festering sore of a restaurant. After the intial review that I input I tried in vain for about 2 weeks before I able to contact the manager ""Freddy"" to complain to him about the incident that occured in his establishment. And shockingly enough he is as poor a manager as Tequilla Grill is an restaurant. When the situation was explained to him he became beligerant and verbally abusive, he finally agreed to look into the incident and promised to call me back. GUESS WHAT he never did, when I attempted to follow up he had an instant case of amnesia and informed me he had no idea what I was talking about and he felt I wasting his time. The only time wasted is by the patrons of this establishment, they could go to Taco Bell and receive better food and service. The owner of this establishment should be dropped in the middle of Baghdad wrapped in an American flag and left to fend for himself with his filthy silverware and horrible food."
2	neg	train	We were a bit disappointed in this one. The seating was outside with ocean view. The service was slow, even though there seemed to be many staff standing around. It took quite a while to get our food and it was around 2:00 (not during the actual lunch rush). I was not impressed by this one.
3	neg	train	"Boisterous, friendly, and busy defines this Vero Beach instituiton. The food is good and plentiful and the servers are efficient. The atmosphere is ""old Florida"", and the nightly crowds are the best indicator that the Patio offers good value and fun for the casual diner."
1	neg	train	Management allowed a minor mold complaint at another table to escalate into a 3 table discussion. All the patrons agreed it was green and it was mold. Management did not let it die and continued to argue that it was not mold. The minor mold issue was clearly not the issue in the end. The issue was their inability to resolve a customer complaint.
3	neg	train	A national chain that specializes in upscale Asian food. Dishes are consistent for location to location. Wine list provides many options. The wait staff is friendly but are more concerned with socializing with co-workers than providing service for the customers.
1	neg	train	This is NOT chili! No bean, and grit for meat. The sweatness mixed with the grossness. The best part about it is the bun if it's a chili dog, and the cheese if it's on spaghetti. So, why not save the time, and money, and make yourself a cheese sandwich at home. (on a hotdog bun)
2	neg	train	They changed the way the prepared the fish to hide that it was not fresh fish. It made both my wife and I stay away from fish for quite a while.
3	neg	train	Casual tymed family seafood with a lively bar. Fried foods are the largest portion of the menu. Several beers are offered on tap. Dried out broiled flounder was taken off the bill without question
3	neg	train	Excellent place to experience Ethiopian Cuisine. We are vegetarians and their vegetarian prepartions have managed to be within the accepted range. As we have tried out most of the Ethiopian Restaurants in the Bay area. Their Timatim Salad is excellent and can be made very hot - spicy - if requested.
2	neg	train	I didn't really like this only because I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza and this is a really thin crust. It wasn't too bad...if you like that kind of pizza, this place is for you
1	neg	train	TERRIBLE! The place is a breeding ground for roaches. The food was very ordinary. I can't complain about the service! There wasn't any! The alleged manager is the original Village Idiot. FORGET IT!
2	neg	train	Restrooms were filthy, no paper to wipe hands. Price too high. I've been to this place many times. No more Rice Palace for me
3	neg	train	Interesting place. It's actually INSIDE Dave's Supermarket. They've taken to traditional grocery story deli and turned it into a full cafe with a place to sit and eat. They have a wide selection of food, bu the chicken is the best selling. The prices are very reasonable. It's really great if your shopping and get hungry...pull your cart up and grab a bite to eat. This is definately not your typical supermarket deli nor your typical cafe...it's kind of something in between.
1	neg	train	"I have been here multiple times and enjoyed the great burgers and cozy, low key atmosphere. While pregnant, I had a huge craving for one of the burgers and drove about 45 mins and waited for them to open to get one. You can't eat blue cheese while preggy (listeria concern), so I asked for it on the side. No can do! There is no deviation on the burger, pregnant or not. They pointed out the ""no substitution"" language, but I didn't want a sub, just put it on the side. Anyway, they have a right to run the biz w/ food first, customers not and I have a right to let others know and go to the Apple Pan, which I loved, to satisfy my pregnancy cravings. Its a shame, b/c I really liked this place but no way will I go back and that goes about 1000x for my (protective given my condition) hubby. So just be forewarned if you do go there. Its their way or the highway."
1	neg	train	Takes forever to get your food, there were barrely anyone there.
2	neg	train	The wait staff of the old Devonsleigh was great, but I guess they've let most of them go. The one we had was new, and only cleared the table of dirty dishes when the next serving came. They seem vastly understaffed and no bus boys. Waiters won't take drink orders, and the drink guy doesn't come around - and we even had to pour our own wine. Pass on the Oysters Rockefeller appetizer but the shrimp cocktail is great - only 3 but huge ($19). Caesar Salad small and ordinary. Back Ribs ($28) were overdone, dry and hard to cut - and the waiter didn't deliver finger bowls. Linquinin had one (large) shrimp and a couple of scallops ($24) and were OK - better at an Italian place. Prime rib was pretty thin compared to the former Devonsleigh servings and not nearly as tasty. Cheesecake terrible. Molten Chocolate good. Spanish Coffee good for $6. This place has a long ways to go before we'll come back. They want to please but need more staff and the new cooks need to get fired before it's too late for them.
1	neg	train	"Father's day outing gone bad could best describe the theme of the day! The all you can eat buffet was just terrible. Institutional food could best describe the taste and appearance of the food. Potato, artichoke, and shrimp salads were warm and kept in open bowls not on ice. I think possibly those salads could spoil under that type of condition and fermentation of certain bacterias were probably the cause of the suspicious taste! Serving containers were often left empty for tens of minutes at a time. One server to handle the two omelet pans while also serving carved turkey, roast beef, and ham allowed patrons to also wait for tens of minutes just to get served. To solve this problem, the manager on staff, John(and John is his real name!) shook my hand and guaranteed my personal attention as his server ignored me once again when it was my turn to be served. All of this coming after we gave our reservation confirmation number and were told that ""we don't have that reservation confirmation number,"" after we were also guaranteed that number and verified by the manager, John, four days prior to Father's Day. Needless to say a staff that didn't care and institutional food! I might as well have been in prison! To be told what to eat and when to eat, sounds alot like a correctional institution to me!"
3	neg	train	While the food is ok by Iowa standards, it is terribly over-priced by any major city standards. I have had some of the best meals of my life in NY City for the same price as this place charges for medium quality food. I guess the poor food quality elsewhere in the area means they can get away with over charging. Also the no reservation policy is frankly insensitive to anyone who works for a living and doesn't have over an hour to kill walking around a small town freezing to death. If you want a sense of this place, call their number when they are closed and listen to their answering machine. It sounds like a prank caller left the message. Out of towners, you can look forward to a friendly waitress telling you to come back in an hour and a half in a tone implying waiting outside for that amount of time will be very fun (the place is too small to let you stand in doors - hope for good weather!). A big disappointment. This place needs to come back to earth.
3	neg	train	"The food was not as flavorful as I had hoped it would be. The service was good - interesting that they serve the men first - guess that is the ""old culture"" of the place. The flaminco show was very entertaining but we felt that we were a little crammed into the dining room. Little room for intimate conversation."
3	neg	train	"Since I first started living in Vienna, and this cafe was close by, I often dropped in. Mostly, this was due to the combination of cafe and book store. For a while, as an embellishment to the Vienna cafe practice offering a large selection of daily newspapers to peruse, one could also find the New Yorker. Alas, the cafe, which I believe also opened just that year, 2000, gave up their subscription. Another primary reason for making this choice: the cafe serves Illy cafe, without a doubt the best coffee in the world. Unfortunately, the barista often ruined the coffee, and even the ""schlag"" was applied from a pressurized can when one ordered a cappuccino with cream. There were more unfortunates: no outside seating, the seating inside not to my liking, lots of smoking by other patrons, and very slow undependable service. I went from being a frequent patron to skipping the place altogether. The cafe in fact, became somewhat notorious in the first district of Vienna for its service. The owner seemed to be a petit, slightly iconoclastic woman, who while always present, seemed disinterested in her guests or the service. Typically unfriendly in that Austrian way, its amazing I kept returning. Partly, the cafe kept trying new things. Eventually they began to serve a brunch on Saturdays, some live music usually in a jazz format, and a new young kid began trying to make eclectic main dishes. I returned this season and had lunch there this week. The change seemed 100%. The service, for the first time, at each turn of the process was quick. I say outdoors. The food simplified, tasted great, and the Espresso Machiato arrived in perfect shape. Complaints: the furniture, outdoors and in remains extremely uncomfortable for me. I make sure to always bring a sweater or some-such to serve as a make shift cushion, but soon my back ached from the metal shape of the chair back. Inside, the same ungainly high chairs, in an atrocious, now faded and stained orange remain the alternative. The smoke from patrons compromise everything, especially the taste of what is not great food and coffee. When I am not in my Poipu beach in Kauai, this remains a choice for coffee. And there are more places to consider in Vienna, you can reach me if you like at info@mypoipubeach.com. The book library seems better organized now, but at a cost of greater density in what is a very tight space. Overall, the place remains a disappointment from what one might hope it could be: A truly comfortable place to linger over books. Presumably this conception founded the cafe. Lamentably, in this it remains a failure, but it has become a better place. I can only hope the progress continues! And how about that New Yorker subscription!"
3	neg	train	"While visiting family in Toronto (East York) we were taken to a local coffee house. It was April 3 and snowing like mad! We didn't think they'd be open, but the owner greeted us at the door, seated us and took our specialty coffee and pastry order. They offered organic, fair trade coffee and tea, hot chocolate and soy products. We ordered a maple syrup latte, a soy latte and cappuccino. We all quite enjoyed the coffee and assorted pastries (made at a local bakery). Jazz playing on the stereo, organic and natural products on the shelves and an ""honour"" library at the rear. Very clean washrooms. We'll be going back later in the week. Cheers. Karl"
1	neg	train	"For our appetizer, We ordered Shrimp Cocktail and 1/2 pounds of steamed shrimp along with other appetizers. My girlfriend noticed that they gave 5 shrimps on our shrimp cocktail order & about 30 counts of steam shrimps in other order. Shrimp cocktail price was $9.95 and 1/2 Steamed Shrimp was $7.75. My girlfriend told the manager there is something wrong with shrimp pricing. How come Shrimp cocktail order cost more with just 5 shrimps. The managers smartly told us not to judge them by number of shrimps on its plate. He stated that it is the weight that we need to consider. I replied to him that ""It must be a 5 super shrimp"" and manager replied in loud voice....""Why are you complaining with our food/price $#@!%"" and we were told not to come again....."
3	neg	train	We've been many times and the experience and food is consistent. The service once seated is generally slower than what's expected in a small cafe like this one, but the servers are very nice. As for the food, the best banana pancakes I've ever had but get half an order unless you're a huge eater, and the other dishes are a great infusion of I think Brazilian food is and what folks will eat.
1	neg	train	The food was below mediocre, the service was beyond slow, and the host was hardly cordial. There is nothing about this establishment that makes it better than Taco Bell. Including the atmosphere.
3	neg	train	Not the best sandwhich shop around. They serve most sandwhiches either hot or cold, but they're not toasted. It kinda tasted like they were just thrown in the microwave. Nothing too special, but not bad either. Apparently they have quite a few shops around the Quad Cities and in Iowa, so it must be pretty popular.
3	neg	train	This is one of the main restaurants nthe Westin Hotel on Hilton Head. I was there for breakfast, and had the buffet. Although the presentation was beautiful and the offerings were plentiful, the food was taseless and tepid. If given the opportunity, eat away from the hotel, as there are hundreds of great restaurants on the island.
2	neg	train	The place is a dump and the food is iffy. Very smokey inside even though it's got a big non-smoking section.
3	neg	train	This was our second visit to the Hong Kong Buffet despite it's being located quite a distance from our home and we enjoyed the experience nearly as much this time as we did the last. Our only difficulty on this visit was a language problem with our server which led to her bringing me a non-diet soda which,being that I am diabetic,could have been a major problem. Overall,the food here is quite delicious and well-prepared. On both of our visits we had their $8.99 Sunday buffet which included many seafood choices.
3	neg	train	This place is located at the Oak Terrace Resort outside of Pana. If your not looking for it, it's pretty hard to find. The restuarant is connected to the hotel and banquet room. The food isn't bad and neither is the price. There's nothing special about it, but convenient if your staying at the resort.
1	neg	train	"On the occasion that I visited this horrible place there must of been what one can only assume was a sewer problem. As the employees were scrambling to vacuum the brown liquid pouring into the dining area and throw rugs over it the smell of an outhouse permeated the room, I was sitting about 6 feet away. Food continued to be served from the kitchen as the manager said quite loudly keep the kitchen door closed. When my food arrived obviously I was sickened, I asked my frantic server what was happening she said ""problem in the kitchen"" and scurried away. Unless you're looking to spend some time in the hospital stay away from Rookie's, Allentown!!!!!!!!!!!"
2	neg	train	Lower middle class diner atmosphere filled with unrully kids and apathetic parents - gruff waitress seemed annoyed to take our order. Food blase' - German food should be pretty simple to make well - unless your chef was trained in prison! On the up side - the beer was good - Spaten Octoberfest.
2	neg	train	After the reviews I had read, we were a bit disappointed. It didn't seem superiour to other upscale Italian places. Maybe my expections were just too high.
2	neg	train	The Service was AWFUL. The experinece was embarrassing after bringng all my friends there for a birthday. food was ok but drastically over priced.
3	neg	train	Not enough Salmon sushi for everyone. I think the sushi makers have been asked to slow down on making salmon sushi. After people empty out the salmon sushi, they didn't bring out more but yet let it sit empty for 20-30 mins before they fill it up. This is ridiculous.
2	neg	train	Good, healthy, relatively sophisticated food. Service slow, distracted, really incompetent. This is a problem of several years. We keep hoping they will upgrade service to match food.
2	neg	train	"The food and the service were excellent. There was a problem in that it was too hot inside and the tobacco smoke was overwhelming. Two of our party had to go outside to get fresh air. The front doors were finally propped open and that helped the temperature but not the tobacco smoke. I sure hope the ""no smoking"" ordinance gets passed soon."
1	neg	train	The owner HATES kids, wishes he could keep them out of the restaurant. He yelled at me and my friend because a two year old was dropping french fries on the floor. Then threatened to call the police if we left without paying. I will do all I can to keep families out of this restaurant. The owner is not the same as the rest of the Manhattan Deli & Restaurants in the area. DON'T BRING CHILDREN TO THIS RESTAURANT!!!
2	neg	train	We ate there in April, and it was wonderful! So we headed straight there in August, and it was a complete letdown. The same dishes that had been terrific four months ago were now completely ordinary at best, and not worth the price. Kids' menu was very overpriced. Service was slow, and not knowledable about food or wine. A nice atmosphere, but something has gone very wrong with the food preparation and service.
3	neg	train	We went there with friends (we live in LV) to bring a friend from out of town to check it out. The pina coladas were fanastic, and some of the foods REALLY good but not worth the price. The service was lacking in general but our waiter was superb. IWere I to return I wiold get the bacon wrapped chicken, the brown rice and some plantains but I would not order the firepit again. Not worth the money. It was a cool, trendy place to take your close friends who visit though.
1	neg	train	Years ago, this USED to be a half-way decent place to eat...not anymore! The food for our group was either cold or half-cooked, the help was indifferent when they weren't incompetent, and the restaurant was just plain dirty! Don't even get me started on the bathroom...a Haz-Mat team needed to be called in for it! If someone suggests this to you, RUN don't walk away from them!
1	neg	train	What a bad dining experience. First, it took them forever to bring us our entrees. Then they got one of the entrees wrong. Then they tried to make up for it by offering us dessert, on the house. But the tiramisu was the worst I've ever had (okay, maybe second-worst only to what I can get at the corner deli). Then two weeks later I read a Dept. of Health report that they had vermin on the premises. What a shame. It's in a great location, but the management is of the place is terrible.
1	neg	train	We returned after associates of ours said that the former General Manager and Chef, Valerie Morris had been replaced...we thought the food and service may have improved under the ownership of Dennis and Michelle Scott...sadly to our dismay, the food quality, particularly the fish freshness was no better..the wine prices were still astronomically high...the service was still marginal...JUST PASS
1	neg	train	Well where do I began, We went at night and the young lady (rang us up) and young man(who sat us) we very nice and I know have been there for years. There was a young lady with long blonde hair that was there for quite some time that was the reason we went there so often but for some reason is not there any more so we only go once in awhile. I know alot of people who dont go there any more because shes not there, but anyway the food and other staff members are not what it used to be and if you go there be forwarned you are taking your chances, but you never know it may be a good day there and you wont get moldy or spoiled food. GOOD LUCK
1	neg	train	The staff were extemely slow and not bothered. They were dressed in horrible black uniforms and very unfriendly. The menu was very basic, they had no deserts. I ordered a bottle of Budweiser which was nealry warm. Not pleasant!
3	neg	train	Nice little place on the edge of town. Huge menu as well as an ice cream shoppe. Foods alright.....huge tenderloins. Service was a little slow. They have pretty good specials as well. Not bad at all if your driving through and need a bite to eat.
1	neg	train	Out of shrimp on Saturday night around 6:45pm. Our simple food took an hour and a half. (Cheeseburgers and gumbo!) Seating hostess with bad attitude.
2	neg	train	"We have tried Hacienda de Vega three times now. The atmosphere outside by the pond is beautiful, but each time we were there the service was horrible. The last time we were there, the waiter dumped an entire tray of filled water glasses on me. I know accidents happen, but he didn't even apologize. His remark was, ""Oh great. I'm never going to hear the end of this."" We were virtually ignored the rest of the evening and had to flag down other wait staff to get drink refills and the check. The food was mediocre at best. The house drinks are fabulous, but the poor service wasn't worth it."
3	neg	train	San Chang Korean Restaurant is a simply furnished place with absolutely stunning food and great service. We tried several dishes, including their Seasoned Cold Noodles, Hot Noodle Soup, and Bul Go Gi. They offer a whole selection of dishes, ranging from sweet to fiery hot. A great selection of Kim Chee is always offered with the main courses. They also have Korean beers and spirits. San Chang has been rated The Best Korean Restaurant in Colorado Springs by the local newspaper, and I would have to agree with the rating. In fact, to get Korean food this good anywhere else, I would have to board a flight to the west coast (or for that matter, Korea). San Chang is located at the corner of Austin Bluffs and Academy Blvd., on the southwest corner in a strip mall right behind Fazoli's.
1	neg	train	The food at Herbivore is very good. They do a great job with veggies! The major drawback is the EXTREMELY POOR service-- we've been ignored/had mistakes in our order/been overcharged/undercharged on our bill so often that we stopped going there; it can be an excercise in frustration if you are hungry/in a hurry/thirsty/looking for a pleasurable meal.
1	neg	train	The very first time we were in Billings we just actually looked in the Yellow Pages and the ad for The Granary sounded like a really neat place...so we went. It was very good. Service was good, food was good and it is a really cute place with alot of history. Being from the South we sometimes do not care for food in many areas of the country, but the Granary was very good.
1	neg	train	Ms. Chung & Ms Paula Smith... I absolutely concur with your comment. I don't think they could ever become like 4 star restaurant. Quality of service & food must be improved immediately. I think their prices are exorbitantly expensive considering that they are just located in Glen Burnie, Maryland.....I could somewhat understand if they were located in NYC.
2	neg	train	The ambiance of this place is like eating in a bowling alley. Cheap, poorly lit and pooly maintained. Prices are sky high and way out of proportion to the low quality space and low quality steaks. Most steaks are in the $22 to $30 range and ours were NOT WORTH it. Service was fast and good but I will not return. Try almost any other steak house and you will most likely be more pleased.
1	neg	train	"Arrived with our two middle school children with reservations. Waited 10 minutes to be seated while owner drooled over the ""Rich and Famous"" who arrived after us. We finally asked to be seated. Waited 10 minutes--no lie--to be waited on. In the interim, owner waited on the two tables beside us seated with Hollywood bigwigs who arrived after us. We are 15 yr residents of Malibu and don't recommend...Try Guido's, Tony's or Marmalade instead."
3	neg	train	I have been going there for years and for the most part it was always good. That was until this evening when I went with my Mother. The waitress we had seemed like she would rather be somewhere else. She dumped a cup of coffee all over the table, necessitating that we move to another one then left the mess for the busboy to clean up. Later when she refilled my teapot, I asked for a new teabag and her response was that they now charged for EXTRA condiments and tea bags but she would sneak me one anyway; I never got it as she seemed to forget even though she passed by our table several times before we left. I would expect something like that from a Fast Food place, not an upscale Sit Down restaurant!
2	neg	train	We visited the Panda Buffet last Sunday while we were out wandering along the Connecticut coast.Upon entering the restaurant we were highly impressed by it's beautiful fountain full of decorative carp and the aquarium of huge tropical fish at the front.The remainder of the restaurant was also quite nicely decorated.Unfortunately,the food was not of the same caliber as the decor.Except for the General's Chicken,nothing had the proper flavors.Everything was either very bland or very sloppily prepared.Our greatest disappointment came with their self-serve ice cream freezer.I watched as a girl of about the age of 12 actually scooped up samples of each flavor of the ice cream and tasted them by licking the ice cream scooper.I Couldn't believe my eyes!I noticed that two of the waitresses were also observing the girl's actions!They did nothing to stop her and,even when I said something to them about it,they still did nothing!Clean ice cream scoopers were not even put out!All of the ice cream should have been discarded and the girl's parent's should have been charged for it.This was a blatant disregard of proper health code practices!We left in disgust!
1	neg	train	My family and I dined at the Steak n Shake in Newark, Ohio. Both times I ordered and DID NOT get what I had ordered the way I had ordered it. Just this past Saturday 3/26/05 My husband and I took my Aunt and a friend of her's out to dinner. I ordered a taco sald with no sour cream no sauces no dressings....it came smothered in ranch dressing. I then ordered a dessert...the brownie fudge sundae.....I got a plain ole fudge sundae.. the waitress said she thought I had wanted/ordered the brownie sundae but was not sure she had heard me right..........so why not repeat my order or ask me if she was not sure???????........yes the waitress offered to take it all back and get other for me......but come on........two times in a row of eating in there and both times my meals were not served/fixed as I had ordered. By the time I would have gotten my meal the others in my group would have been finished eating. I also ordered chili delux both times I was in there and both times it was barely warm........chili should be piping hot when served. This is my first time ever in giving a rating on a restaurant where I have eaten.....it has to be really bad for me to complain.
1	neg	train	Service was terrible. Some orders were wrong and the staff did not try to correct them. Some orders were served incomplete. We were not served our rolls. The food was set on the table and the server never returned untill the check was brought. Staff and manager were unpleasant. Numerous items on the menu were not available. We had a large group and were celebrating a graduation otherwise we would have walked out.
1	neg	train	Oh my god, I am not sure where the last reviewer was thinking. I have been going to the Buffet (East Buffet) behind this location for years and so have most of the asians in the area. This place charges the lowest prices 8.00 for dinner! The food was mild and nothing to write home about. When I go out I want to be able to eat and enjoy, there was no peking duck, no prime rib. There was nothing to eat period.
2	neg	train	This place shouldn't be called the No Name bar and Grill, it should be called the No Service Bar & Grill. I was working away from my office the other day and thought I'd try this place on the square in Tyler since I was is the area. Needless to say it was a mistake. I walk in, order, and 35 MINUTES later get a burger that was ok at best. I only saw my waiter once the entire time and at one point he LEFT THE PLACE. So, while I know you can't expect the best from a cheap little place like this, there's no excuse for terrible service. Hope you don't make the same mistake I did.
1	neg	train	Food was way too overpriced for the quality of food. The portions were small, and the food really lacked a lot of flavor. The atmoshpere is okay, but I would never eat there again. Oh, parking is also sparse.
1	neg	train	Too bad this site does not offer a negative rating. The entire table chose to order the buffet. The buffet was nearly empty of food and the lighting was horrible. I am not exaggerating to say that you could barely see the food in the trays. The food itself was abyssmal. Greasy, greasy,greasy. The rice was as tough as gristle. The waitress was very unpleasant and inattentive. The restaurant was not busy, so there was no excuse for the poor service. I specifically got up from the table and went to find a waitress to take our drink order, or to at least have our waitress come to take the order, and then was told by the manager that the woman I had spoke with wasn't our waitress. That does not matter. Good staffing knows that you just say okay and send someone to take the order. When the waitress did come she was very flippant with the table and sloshed the drinks. After complaining to the owner about the food and the service and how we would not be back because of both, he not only did not apologize or offer to take anything off the bill but said that was our choice. An absolutely horrible dining experience which was just a shame because we had went there to celebrate one of our birthdays. I have lived in Morgantown 16 years and dined at many fine -- and not so fine -- restaurants. This is easily the worst. Best advice, RUN DO NOT WALK away from this horrible and rude dining experience.
2	neg	train	"Such a disappointment!! Noisey conventioneers, crying babies, rude hostess. Management indifferent and made us feel like we were ""lucky"" to be eating at his establishment. Food was okay, but service and atmosphere make this place tolerable for lunch, BAD FOR DINNER"
1	neg	train	It was the worst meal of my life. I don't even understand how they are in business. The health department should go check that place out to see if the food is edible. I ordered the cheebo supreme sandwich and the baked lasagna. The sandwich was burnt meat on dry tasteless bread, the only thing that made it taste good was ketchup. The lasagna had maybe a half a noodle that was burnt, the rest was a meat sauce that tasted similar to chili out of a can. Just thought I should warn people.
1	neg	train	"My husband and I dined at Padovani's Restaurant and Wine Bar on Saturday evening, July 31st, 2004. I hope others' experiences are more enjoyable than ours. We like to dine out, and do so quite often. When we were younger, both of us worked in the restaurant business. All of this may explain our somewhat high expectations, especially at an establishment that boasts ""Fine Dining"". We're not sure if our dissatisfaction stemmed from the rudeness of the host when we asked to be seated at a table off to the side instead of the table at which we were initially seated in the center of the first dining area (the host quickly grunted, ""Well, I'll have to set the table, and you'll have to get up and wait!""), or if it was the fact that the A/C wasn't working, and when we mentioned how uncomfortably warm it was to both the waiter and the host, their only responses were off-handed jokes. Maybe it was because the waiter--when we asked what was on the appetizer sampler--didn't know what was being offered, and seemed put-out by the fact that we wanted to know. The presentation of the food was mediocre, although the flavors were quite good; but the taste of the food was overshadowed by the other elements of the evening. Anyway, we like to give people second chances. So we offered our waiter a taste of the wine we brought to the restaurant, a 1999 Silver Oak Alexander Valley Cab. Several minutes later he brought over an empty glass and took us up on our offer. Surprisingly, when we poured him the wine--a generous portion, I might add--he just picked up the glass and walked away. And throughout the rest of the meal, he never mentioned the wine again--until, of course, he let us know that there would be a corkage fee of $30. We expected some sort of fee--after all, the fee is customary, as you know (although I'll admit that in most restaurants, the waiter waives the fee if he or she is offered a taste; but I digress). Here lies my question, and other than wanting to express our unique experience at Padovani's, this is my reason for writing: When we were charged the corkage fee, we were also told of their policy for customers who bring their own wine, that, in addition to the corkage fee, the customer must also purchase a bottle of wine from their wine list. Maybe my experiences have been limited, but in all of my years of dining out, I have never heard of this policy. How common is this? Needless to say, we didn't purchase their wine, and we'll never dine there again. Lastly, thanks for listening. It's painful to spend so much money on such a disappointing experience. Next time we want to celebrate, I think we'll serve ourselves. Happy Dining"
2	neg	train	Was squeezed into side porch an area which was designed for tables of two Food was constantly passed across the table by waiter because he unable to get around the table.The dinner rolls were stale and the drinks we ordered were like water.
1	neg	train	"Restaurant was promoting 25% off entree from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM. A party of four of us decided to try this restaurant. We drove 24 miles only to arrive at 6:02 PM by the restaurants clock, 5:58 PM by our clock. We asked about the discount and were told, ""You are too late, it's 6:02""."" We asked if they could make an exception because we drove so far and were only 2 minutes beyond the cutoff, the answer was, ""If we make an exception for you, we will have to make an exception for everybody"". We went elswhere, had a fine dinner, and spent $150. at one of their competitors."
3	neg	train	The food was good but this was the second time in a row the waiter did not get the order right. The service is also slow.
2	neg	train	People, bargain sushi is not a bargain! It's full because it's cheap. period. I will say their miso soup is my favorite, but it's not a purist's form of miso.
2	neg	train	The service was bad. The food was flavorful but cold.
2	neg	train	"Since it was a gorgeous sunny day, our party opted to be seated on the patio. That was the ONLY good part of our experience. That is, up until the birds hanging on the palm trees overhead started defecating on our meal. My friend ended up having her salad completely ruined. Not only were we not told that this could be the case if we sat outside, the server rudely informed us that to choose to sit outside was to ""eat at your own risk."" Gosh, we wish she'de mention this AHEAD of time, and NOT after the fact. PLUS, the serving staff then feebly attempted to exchange the salad, but did not make ANY apology or suffice arrangements. It was a terrible experience, topped off with the server's negativity towards our party the rest of the meal. Needless to say, we cut the meal VERY short and agreed to contact the owner to let him know our families and friends would not be pleased with our situation."
1	neg	train	My brother and I took our parents here for their anniversary. The experience was enough to make my parents divorce. My father wanted to complain about the service and the food but my mother was too polite to allow him to to so. Instead of complaining, my parents started arguing. The food was very small and was not very tasty. My father had the Pork chop and it had hair in it. My mother tried a few of the satays. Tasted alright but were very small. My brother tried the salmon and I had the tuna. Both were overdone and resembled what you get on an airplane. Service was very robotic. She was stiff like a cardboard cut out. Desserts were average. Creme brulee was creative but very small. There are better restaurants in Vancouver.
1	neg	train	Outstanding meal w/ great service. The full rack of ribs is among the best we've ever had. Don't miss our on this restaurant!
1	neg	train	I/We have eagerly and frequently visited many Todai Restaurant locations in the past years. However, out of all the Todai locations, Puente Hills experience was a TERRIBLE one. They are an embarrassment to the Todai name and their quality of food, customer service, choices overall were simply disgusting. I brought it to the manager's attention but she didn't have much to say except apologize minimally. If you have never been to a Todai, don't ruin your appetite and interest by visiting this location. If you are a regular Todai customer, don't waste your tastebuds and time at this location because it will an experience you'll truly regret... In another words, this Todai should change their name to Worst-Todai in order to warn their customers before their experience and to save face of Todai name! In Simple Statement... Disgusting!!!!!
2	neg	train	My Wife and I went during lunchtime and even though they were quite busy we were seated fairly quickly. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Especially the Tank with Jelly fish (beautiful) and the running water fall. The decor is pleasant too. We ordered an appetizer of Crab Rangoon (won-tons) and I was pleasantly surprised to see crab in it. The sauce that they served with it was less desiring. My Wife ordered the Combination Fried Rice and I ordered the lunch Sui Sui Noodles (diced chicken, green onions, Chinese noodles, sauce) and a cup of Hot & Sour Soup. The service was not bad. Our server was present when we needed her and was friendly. When the food came my wife mentioned how something did not smell quite right but I was stuffed up and could not smell it. I ignored her and ate away. The Soup was ok nothing spectacular, I tried some of the fried rice and it was bland but had a good taste to it. The Sui Sui noodles had a spicy kick to it and I enjoyed the bite but the noodles were a bit too greasy. As far as size portions, there was more than enough food and for the sizes it was fairly priced. BUT, both my Wife and I felt sick immediately after leaving he restaurant. Something about the food made both of us feel nauseous. I then had wished that I had listened to my wife when she said something did not smell right. We definitely will not be returning to this restaurant.
1	neg	train	We had to wait another 30 minutes to be seated after we arrived at the exact time of our reservation. The place was packed and loud and uncomfortable. The service slow. I kept getting bumped by the passer-by's behind my seat. I suggest they take out some seats in the patio and make the seating roomier. Forget the ol mighty buck. Very disappointed after looking forward to a great dining experience.
2	neg	train	It was weird. I have had a couple of bad experiences with this restaurant. The server actually us asked to hurry up and finish eating!! (What lovely hospitality!!) Being far from what actual Indian food is like, this restaurant is a strict No-no!! We go there only because there is no other Indian eat-out within 80 miles!! Wonderful business opportunity for others to start one in Morgantown
3	neg	train	Well, the buffet is pretty good, that's true. But much overpriced, though, for what it really is. Service was minimal. The room in the back is minimalist but nice, and creates a special atmosphere.
3	neg	train	Really a great place in such a small town. You don't have many choices in Hopedale, but this one will do just fine.
1	neg	train	"We had a great evening right up until we asked for the check. The bill came to us with a 15% tip added on and written in red ink. As the rest of the bill was black & white the red ""samba suggested service"" really stood out. Below was written a new total incorporating the self imposed tip, also in red ink. When we inquired about it, Steven, the server said it was due to the high number of tourists who eat there and don't tip. I would like to mention that it was evident from my accent that I was Canadian or American, both of which ARE tipping cultures. I spoke to the manager who also stood behind this procedure. It was arrogant beyond belief and insulting. It is the only restaurant I know of that does this. I can understand a added tip if we were a large group, but there were only 2 of us. I am in the industry and would surely get fired for even suggesting a tip, let alone writing it on a bill. I simply know better. According to Steven the Thai House restaurant in Yaletown is owned by the same company and also follows this same practice. What this restaurant does is no different than standing at the table with an out-stretched hand. As good as the food was, this bill fiasco is what I am carrying away with me and I won't be back."
3	neg	train	"The Great Wall seems to be too small of a restaurant to offer a buffet,but they do and the food is actually pretty good! They even had shrimp cocktail on their $4.95 lunch buffet as well as REAL onion rings!Their wonton soup was very good as was their General's chicken. The Great Wall's major shortcoming was their service.The lone waitress was overwhelmed and nearly dropped half a bowl of ""used"" soup on my wife when she was juggling an armload of dirty dishes.We had to ask the cook for refills on our drinks, only to be told that we were supposed to refill them ourselves! With some polishing of their wait staff, the Great wall could be an excellent restaurant. Even as it is now,their buffet is a very good bargain!"
3	neg	train	We met some family and friends for dinner at The Prime Rib Loft in the Orleans Hotel in Las Vegas. The menu was limited in my opinion. The service was really not that great, especially since it was a Wednesday night and not really that busy. We first ordered drinks, which were very small and my Hurricane was in a 6-7 oz glass and had barely any alcohol at all. It was not served in a Hurricane glass and was simply disappointing. Especially that we were in a New Orleans-themed Casino and that I am spoiled having been born and raised in New Orleans. Well, I realize not everyone comes out of the womb knowing how to make a Hurricane like us N'awlins gals so all is forgiven, moving along... The waiter took quite a while getting back to us to to take our food order, I started getting annoyed. Also the butter, although serves in cute little swirly shapes, was cold and hard as a rock. I can't stand hard butter. That can ruin a restaurant for me. If they can't get that one detail right, how can they get the rest of it right? My fiance got Chicken and Dumplings (since I rarely make it for him myself) and I got the only thing which I felt was appetizing, bow tie pasta and mushrooms with an alfredo-pesto sauce. Two people got prime rib which they liked very much. And the other two both had the beef medallions, which they liked very much. Their baked potatoes looked divine and made me wish I had ordered beef. The chicken and dumplings looked more like a crustless chicken pot pie with all the carrots and peas it had in it and then had a split chicken breast, one piece on each side, with like three dumplings and NO RICE. Who serves chicken and dumplings with no rice and uses only white meat? Anyway, it was also very bland. My fiance ate only a few bites and sat there looking disgusted. My pasta was 'okay' - I expected it to be better, but at last it was inexpensive. I think my entree was about $12.95 while the beef entrees were about $19.95. I did have Bananas Foster in the end though and that was pretty good! So all was not lost :) All in all though, I wouldn't go back.
2	neg	train	Looks like Ms Nikhila Bedi got more than her share of attention from the owner...but then whats new..thats excatly what I had mentioned....(what was the word again????womanising!!!!! thats right) So Nikhila were you paid for the review in kind???? Wont be surprised! hehehehe
1	neg	train	"At the end of March we visited the Hometown Buffet's Waterbury, Ct location for their Wednesday night seafood buffet and we were pleasantly impressed with the quality of the food and of the overall dining experience. In mid-May we decided to try the Thursday ""Barbecue Night"" at Hometown Buffet's Milford, Ct location. It turned out to be one of the worst dining experiences that we have ever endured! Before we began dining I wanted to ""freshen up"", but when I attempted to do so I found that the men's room had no toilet paper or hand towels. The floor was strewn with garbage from the overflowing trash containers. Strike one! When we began dining my wife brought me a plate of ham and roast beef. The waitress attempted to take it when I had barely sampled from it and I had to literally grab it back from her! Strike two! About ten minutes later my wife and I both went up to the buffet simultaneously. At the Hometown Buffet one is supposed to turn their receipt upside down to signify that they are finished dining. We had not done so, but when my wife returned from the buffet she found our table completely cleared and that same waitress in the process of seating another party at it! Strike three! After we reclaimed our table and were finally ready for dessert I, being a diabetic, wanted to try the no-sugar added apple pie that a sign indicated was available on the dessert buffet. There was none under the sign and the kitchen staff were busy so I tried some fruit instead. A few minutes later my wife asked about the no-sugar added apple pie only to be told that they were out of it. The sign was not removed,however! Strike four! The ""Barbecue"" selections available were downright horrible! The ""baby-back"" beef ribs were actually normal beef ribs that had been sawed in half! The pork ribs,strangely,tasted like fish? The ""barbecued beef"" was reminiscent of mashed ""Slim-Jims""! Sadly,with the exception of the cold salads,nothing on the buffet was even close to being edible. Before writing this review I actually contacted Buffets Inc. via e-mail through their website to voice my concerns. I was contacted by the restaurant manager and left with the impression that I would be sent coupons for replacement dinners. I was planning on giving them the benefit of the doubt and basing my review on the ""replacement"" dinners.What I actually received in the mail were discount coupons for $4.99 meals. I contacted Buffets Inc. again only to be informed that they do not issue ""replacement"" meals. Strike five!Oh well, I guess that this place has more than struck out with us!"
3	neg	train	A friend and I stopped into the Irish Pub. There was a sign to please see the hotess for seating. The hostess was a young blonde girl who apparently was too busy talking to her friend eating beside her station. When we did get seated it took a while for the server to acknowledge us. Although she was quite nice, the restaurant wasn't even half full. The time it took her to get back to us each time when we requested things or just even wanted to order was waaaay too long. The place is nice looking but dirty. We were asked if we wanted a lower table or a high top. We chose the high top and the hostess had to find someone to clean both high top tables down because no one had attended to it previously. When sitting at our table I turned and there was all this dust and dirt all over the woodwork in the place like it hadn't been cleaned in ages. Pretty gross. The food on the other hand was quite good. I had a salmon sandwich. For my friend's two Guiness' and my sandwich and water it was only a $16 tab.
2	neg	train	The place looked sketchy, so I ordered a well done burger - a safe bet I thought. I took a bite into the bloody mess and was disgusted. The nice waitress said she would send it back. I got it back still uncooked. The waitress saw that it was still pretty red and was really embarassed. She took it away and brought me some pie instead. There was also someone shaving in the bathroom - making washing your hands an impossiblity. Not a great thought at a food establishment.
3	neg	train	This is a family style buffet restaurant specializing in Southern Cuisine. After paying upon entry, it is all you can eat for $6.99. Smoked and grilled meats are quite tasty. The fried foods all taste the same. The side dishes are not homemade, but rather right from the can. This is a cheap way to feed folks that enjoy bland food.
1	neg	train	"SERVICE at Latorres: We were in Latorres restaurant the night of Dec 13 and were very impressed by the service that provided to a couple seated close to us. They were provided a special appetizer, attentive but discrete service. Their courses were spaced wonderfully; allowing them to enjoy their meal and your atmosphere. Their water was filled as necessary, and their plates were cleared after they had finished the course and had time to clear their palate for the next serving. That particular couple were seated when we arrived. When we left, they were just being served their main dish. They were clearly being offered service that reflected their desire to enjoy the evening at your establishment. How do we get such service? We were rushed from the moment we arrived. We were hurried to place our orders quickly. Our plates were taken before we finished our course. We treated with utmost disrespect, as if we were a burden upon you. Our courses were brought to us before our previous course was complete, and they were not even warm. To add insult to this injury, the Maitre D' constantly interrupted us to take chairs from our table to suit her needs. (We noticed that she didn't bother the ""special"" guests to whom we refer above.) We went out to have a pleasant, leisurely evening. They know how to offer that (you did for the other couple). Instead, we had a horrible experience. They got our money. And our lasting memory of an awful evening."
1	neg	train	Stay out of this dump ! It's filthy and shouldn't be allowed to serve food.The washrooms should be condemed.They have springs on the taps,if your brave enough to touch them.The bakery is hidden in the basement.We had breakfast I had the omlette which was stuffed with unidentifyable things.The coffee was extra and so was the butter .The doggie bag came in handy because I skipped desert and went straight to the the hospital.
2	neg	train	disappointing
3	neg	train	Barbeque and homestyle comfort foods highlight the menu. Located near the airport and several hotels. Large dacility that fills up quickly. The sides are as good as the entrees.
2	neg	train	I went to Davitino's with my mother and 2 year old son. During the meal the owner/manager walks by and gasps and yells oh my god because my son had dropped some noodles on the floor by his chair. She then sends someone over to VACUUM THEM UP while we are eating our meal!! She continued to rudely stare at my son throughout the rest of our meal, I just couldn't believe it. Davitino's used to be one of my favorite places, but after that incident, I, nor any of my family, will ever eat there again. This was not the first time we have been treated rudely by her, I don't know why I ever went back!!!! P.S. I always clean up the food my son drops on the floor before we leave a restaurant!
1	neg	train	Terrible, terrible, terrible. The wait staff was inattentive, forgetful, and slow. The food had to be returned twice before our correct meal came. Then it was cold and tasteless. The only thing saving this restaurant is the atmosphere and their desserts!
2	neg	train	The first sign of a long, painful night of disappointment was immediately after we were greeted by the hostess. Despite the fact this vast dining room was virtually empty on this particular Tuesday night, we were informed by the hostess that we would have to wait a minimum of twenty minutes, since we did not have a reservation. We were sent to the bar to wait for a table to open' up. There we waited over five minutes to be greeted, as our bartender leisurely tended to some paperwork. Fortunately, right when he came to help us, our table was ready and we were whisked away to a lovely table in the midst of two heavily trafficked pathways. (The restaurant inundated with 5, maybe even 6 tables of customers!) Our server greeted us promptly within a reasonable 10 minutes and returned just as quickly 15 minutes later with our cocktails. He was helpful when he took our order, by confidentially assuring us that every dish we inquired about was certainly his favorite'. He then rushed off to bring us back some bread and crackers. We were delighted when it showed up after our entrees arrived! As for the actual food, the concepts where mildly interesting, despite the fact they followed the standard chain restaurant formula of offering standard fare with the masked by clever variances and quasi-exotic ingredients. Portions where all over the chart; varying from far too large to hilariously small. The food itself was the only thing worthy of any praise. The Pumpkin Ravioli was admittedly delicious, complimented by a sauce composed mostly of brown sugar. The so called bread plate' was a horrid disappointment as it consisted mostly of large pieces of a matzo like substance desperately in need of an accompaniment sauce that never was. Simply put based on this experience, the mildly good food could never justify another trip to this hallmark of failed intentions.
2	neg	train	"Problem here is w/ attitude of management. Lena's is the only family joint in this part of town & it has gone to their heads. Food is generally OK, but salads are limp brown lettuce fiascos. Wait staff is pleasant, but you will never hear a ""Thank you, come again."" or ""How was everything?"" from the owner at the cash register whose name is on the sign. I asked for change for their gum machine and was told ""We are not a bank."" Nice. Someone needs a refresher course in customer service. You will leave w/ a full stomach, but hungry for some acknowledgement that your business was appreciated."
3	neg	train	Basil's is a cute, small bistro located near the Homewood Suites in Pinehurst. An easy walk from the hotel. Seafood is the specialty. The crab cakes were quite nice, though I question if lumo crab meat was actually used, Nonetheless, Basil's is a very nice white table cloth, casual spot, with a menu for everyone.
2	neg	train	The China Buffet located in North Haven,Ct is nothing at all like the restaurant of the same name which is located in Hamden,Ct, which is our favorite Chinese buffet. The food in North Haven was lacking in it's preparation and in it's flavoring. Most items were well below average. When we first arrived for their $5.49 lunch buffet they did have a small amount of a Mongolian pork dish out that was very well prepared in both it's spiciness and the caramellization of it's onions. Later, more of the same dish was put out on the buffet and it was nearly raw! The restaurant was uncomfortably hot and it was actually hotter inside than it was outside! The loudly buzzing air conditioner in the dining room sounded as if it was in it's death throws! Overall,this place needed some help!
3	neg	train	Maya also offers a fine a la carte lunch menu. A pleasant change from a loud taqueria...
2	neg	train	It is a dairy bar. We had a coupon and had never been. We were the only customers they had. We waited too long and were standing right next to the pick up window but he screamed #20 any ways. I orderd fried dough as it seemed to be very well advertised. Condiments for the fried dough were nill. We asked for maple syrup and they had none. Well i'll settle for butter. They had none. The bill for the 2 of us came to $26.00 for a clam plate a chicken sandwich a lemonade the fried dough and a chocolate frappe. The food was hot though. We will not return
2	neg	train	horrible
3	neg	train	A standard Ruby Tuesday. Adequate food, quality and price. Nothing to write home about, but tastes good when you are tired and have few options.
2	neg	train	This restaurant was recommended by the Cruise ship I was on, I found the shrimp factory to be over prices and most of the food was overcooked. The atmosphere would have been great except for the constant locals trying to sell you everything from whistling turtles to getting your hair braided. I had the two pound lobster and Carmen had the peel and eat shrimp our bill camne the 565 pesos or 62.78 with the tip in US dlls. When going to Mexico I go for the great bargains which were hard to come by while dining at the Shrimp Factory..Can You say tourist trap?
1	neg	train	"ughhh...this place was just bad. There's also a ""Burger Express"" drive thru that just isn't much better."
1	neg	train	The menu selections were extremely limited - it took over 1/2 hour to receive the food at lunch time When the food did arrive, the burgers were so salty they were inedible, and the buns were so doughy, we thought they weren't fully cooked. The atmosphere appeals mostly to Jr. High Students, certainly not to adults.
1	neg	train	"My daughter and I ate at the chelinos in bricktown in okc. The service was just horrible I mean horrible. It took forever to get waited on we waited for over 15 minutes just for our drink order,which the bus boy took,then we finally saw our waitress whom finally took our order. The tea was horrible we never got our flour tortillas we ordered we never got refills on chips and queso the salsa was god awful. The kicker was we were still eating when the bus boy started cleaning off our table"" we weren't even done eating"" he put his dirty fingers in our drink glasses and then set them back on our table. We did not drink out of them after this and was not offered another drink or sopillas. I was not happy and should not have paid for our lunch never seen a manager once during this time. We will never dine here again, there are too many businesses in bricktown to eat at we just tried yours and it was in no way pleasant."
1	neg	train	IT WAS NASTY, AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. THE PRICE WAS HIGH, AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THAT MUCH ON THE MENU. I WENT THERE FOR OPTIONS, AND ENDED UP WITH A CHEESEBURGER.
1	neg	train	"The place is beautiful, and the food's excellent. Nevertheless, a friend of mine was a chef there. Here's the scoop on this place: This place treats their kitchen staff like dirt. They ""house"" the staff in rooms smaller than ""isolation"" jail cells (w/ no stove, refrigerator, or any amenities whatsoever, inadequate bathroom facilities & plumbing), charge the staff an exorbitant sum for the ""privilege"" of staying in such accommodations, work them 6-7 days per week, 12 hours or more per day, and pay them a non-living, meager wage (especially the chefs). Additionally, the Inn requires a deposit of $500 from its kitchen staff for the privilege of ""allowing"" the staff to live in the hovel-like conditions of its jail cells, and, when the staff member's time w/ the Inn comes to an end, the Inn refuses to return the worker's deposit, claiming that it hasn't had the chance to survey the jail cell to determine the extent - if any - of any damage done. Outrageous. After all the money they charge the guests for the food and accommodations, this is how they treat their staff. DO NOT CONDONE THIS BEHAVIOR. DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT. IT HAS NO RESPECT FOR THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK THAT MAKES THE PLACE ENJOYABLE FOR ITS GUESTS."
1	neg	train	We waited forever to have our order taken. After our plate of appetizers were finished, the appetizer dips arrived. The beefy tomato macaroni soup was simply tomato soup mix with spaghetti in it. The salad bar was exactly you would expect at Sizzler... only with less selection and poorly maintained. I had the signature rib steak which arrived charred black on the outside and cooked far beyond rare as it was ordered. Surprisingly it was the first tasteless rib steak I had ever experienced. The only highlight of the meal was the complimentary shrimp. Although I know we paid for them. For the $30+ cost of the meal, it was a real disappointment!!!
1	neg	train	"Our dining experience at 227 Bistro in Rochester Michigan was truly disappointing! To begin with, their menu is extremely overpriced, with wine prices being the highest of any restaurant in Southeast Michigan. The service was horrible. Our waitress forgot our drinks, and brought them only after two reminders. We ordered a salad, and never received it. After requesting bread twice, we were told that the kitchen was ""out of bread"". When we asked for a bread substitute, we received stale cold pita bread. We ordered tuna for the entree, which was cold and very bland. When we confronted the owner about the disappointing experience we had, he seemed apathetic. To top it off, we paid what we would have at a 5-star restaurant, while we could have received better food and service at a fast-food restaurant!!! There are MUCH better restaurants in the area- don't waste your time and money at 227 Bistro!!"
3	neg	train	We have always wanted to try the dessert known as frozen custard,so when we noticed a piece about Abbott's Frozen Custard in our local alternative free newspaper we decided to give it a shot.While the frozen custard was comparable in it's richness and flavor to premium ice creams such as Ben&Jerry's,we found the portion size of their classic sundaes to be quite small for $4.29 each.For this price the small cardboard sundae cup should at least have been filled!I had their chocolate almond and my wife had their vanilla.As I stated,both were quite rich and flavorful qualitywise,just not very substantial in their quantity!
1	neg	train	We were told it was a vegetarian restaurant, an since two of us are vegetarian, we went there. However, there was fish and other non vegetarian dishes on the menu, and the only specials they had were fish. One of us did order a fish special, and found something most unpleasant about it. Skipping gross details, it ruined our night out, and our other two meals, which were tasteless at best. On the way out, we talked with a dishwasher about our unfortunate experience, and were horrified to hear that it occurs often. We won't be back
1	neg	train	"I am a Chinese, and I know what's going on all Chinese restaurant. However I never see this kind restaurant, their server ask customer to pay tip. That server used a loudly voice told me ""hey your tip was not enough"" in front all the customer. When my wife asked him, did not the tip represent the satisfaction of service? He asked my wife what he did wrong? He said, ""You should give us more than 10% tip, because we need to pay Tax."" What a stupid reason is it? I had a very bad experience in this Chinese restaurant. I will not come back again. If you do not have a super nice temper, I recommend you do not go to this restaurant."
1	neg	train	If you want to eat fairly good food in a lousy atmosphere with snooty hard to locate waiters while practically sitting in your neighbors lap and yelling across the miniture table at your friends because the place is soooo loud, then this is the place for you! This was a special occasion choice for us, highly touted as the place to go for an excellent dining experience. While the food quality was excellent, beautiful and imaginative, everything else about this place was the opposite - high unpleasant. Other friends also went some time later (despite our warnings) and had a similar unpleasant experience. Would never recommend to anyone. Suggestion? Take about the same amount of money, drive a couple of miles south on La Brea to Campanile and have excellent food in a delightful soothing atmosphere with attentive, sweet and prompt waiters, munch on some of the most delicious bread and food in the city and actually enjoy your evening! When you leave you will be full, happy, relaxed and thinking about what delicious menu item you are going to try the NEXT time you can save up enough pennies and come back there. On your way home, swing by Lucques and laugh as you drive by....
1	neg	train	The bar we waited in was coated with spilled drinks and glasses so high you had to push them aside to get an order in. Oh and they only serve drinks, no grasshoppers, or the like. When we got our table two waitresses argued over whose table we were. Right in front of our table. We had to split up the argument to get served. Then my girlfriends Fettuccini was served FROZEN in the middle. We refused the meal and were treated with hostility. This is supposed to be a high class restaurant in a prestigious Holiday Inn and it's a dump.
3	neg	train	Another example of a fast food Italian place. They make really good sandwhiches. There's multiple locations in the Peoria area and they all do pretty well. The Torpedo is their version of a sub sandwhich and hits the spot when you need dinner quick.
1	neg	train	"Flies!!!!!!!There were a lot of flies everywhere!Just the most unpleasant experience ever. when we mentioned it we were told, ""someone left the kitchen door open"". that was it, no ""I'M sorry"". Will never go back!!!"
3	neg	train	"We arrived at the Hing Wong after several hours of walking around at the Stormville Airport fleamarket in extremely humid conditions.When we entered the restaurant at 11:30 AM we found it to be hotter inside than it was outside!We nearly left,but decided to wait a few minutes for their A/C to kick in. We found most of their food to be very mediocre and unremarkable.Nothing was disgusting,but,except for one item,nothing was particularly good either.The one item that was outstanding was their ""Fried Crab Legs"",which are basically deep fried breaded lumps of crabmeat stuffing which are served on a crab leg segment.These are a favorite of mine ant theirs were the best that I have ever eaten!Even those at the China Buffet in Hamden,Ct do not compare to those served here.If only the rest of their offerings were up to the same standard I would have a new favorite restaurant!We may return here if we are in this area in the future."
1	neg	train	"TABLE TALK Bad Business Under cooked Eggs are dangerous. When I discovered that the omlet I was eating contained uncooked eggs I inconspicuously told the manager/owner. He became very confrontational and loud saying ""There is nothing I can do. Do not eat here. Leave!"" I left and shortly after became nauseous and vomited my meal. I had eaten here many times before and that will be my last. I am hurt and embarrassed that the owner was so unproffesional and unaccommodating."
3	neg	train	Limited menu for a quick lunch. Appa are fried. Beef and Chicken dominate the menu. Slads are basic with chopped lettuce and some tomato.
1	neg	train	"Waxing nostalgic for the lunches you ate in your high school cafeteria? Then make your way to Stacey's Buffet, where steam tables laden with salty food, either under or overcooked, comprise the bulk of your dining experience. Any sauce that may have been added to a chicken and rice dish had evaporated; it was dry and tasteless. A leathery patty of dubious quality meat posed as a ""steak."" Ribs had an undefinable and unpleasant taste we learned was paprika, added because the chef had run out of the appropriate spices. Vergetables are either canned or frozen. The salad bar consisted of wilted lettuce and a variety of accompaniments that looked far from fresh and very unappealing. A wide selection of desserts were overly sweet. Only the dinner rolls merit a positive comment, but man cannot dine on bread alone. The low prices attract a crowd of mostly seniors who obviously are indifferent to what they eat. This is definitely a place to avoid."
2	neg	train	"Would have held up other patrons if we stopped to read ""daily specials"". Asked waitress what they were. She didn't know but would find out. Returned 15 min. later with ""specials"". When we ordered lasagna she became angry and stalked off. Food arrived 30 min. later just as we were ready to leave. Lasagna very ordinary."
2	neg	train	Waiter never came back to refill drinks at all. I asked for extra stuff like napkins and more cheese. The waiter was rude and I felt like I was bothering him. This is not my first experience with this place but it will be the last!
1	neg	train	The Waiters were polite, the owners and the chef were not however. The owners sat and got drunk at the bar and proceeded to interrupt all of the patrons during their meals. The owners were also very disrespectful, yelling at the wait staff in front of patrons. I also saw the owner hit one of his waiters in the back of the head because he didn't put ketchup on our table before the burgers arrived. Terrible little man.
1	neg	train	Food was not good at all. Service was horrendous!
2	neg	train	The menu was extremely limited. They claim to sell Irish food yet all they have is hamburgers and fries etc!. We ate at the bar, so the tall beardy bartender served us. He did'nt wipe down the bar for us which was stained with alcohol. When we questioned the menu he said if we did'n like it go somewhere else. We decided to eat anyway and halfway through our long awaited meal we discovered the same bartender behind the bar picking his nose!. We left striaght away.
3	neg	train	Just another bar that serves an average pizza. Lots of other sandwhiches too. Not bad, but you can do better in Pekin
3	neg	train	Large restaurant overlooking a marsh. Family friendly atmosphere--with a large playgound outside. Menu consists of basic seafood platters, broiled or fried. Great She Crab soup. Good Lunch spot.
1	neg	train	Owner of the restaurant extremely rude. We had a party of 30 for a birthday party and was rushed and hustled out of the place...told that there was a 1 hour 25 minute limit. Never heard of such a thing! Will not ever return...intend to make it a point to tell everyone I know to avoid this place.
2	neg	train	My wifes pork was good, she said it has been good in the past. I usually eat ribs, and have been happy. But this time I tried the beer battered fish; big mistake! The fish itself was mushy, and the coating was soaked with greese. Never again for the fish. Also this time the onion rings were also loaded with grease. Maybe the cook was new, or didn't give a damn. I will eat there again, but would not eat the fish.
1	neg	train	This is the 3rd time eating at this restaurant, each time progressively worse. The 2nd and 3rd times have been because it was a friend's birthday (who requested to try it) and the 3rd time was because they advertised internet connections (which wasn't true). The food was terrible, cold when should be warm, soup was burned tasting, told side salad was $2.50 and charged $3.00. Promised cannolis because of the problems - then another person said they wouldn't give them to us. Overall, terrible. I will tell everyone I know not to go to Cinelli's.
2	neg	train	We were very disappointed with Cedars. We were told that it was a good restaurant and were quite excited to be dining there. We called ahead to make reservations but were told to simply show up. When we showed up we had to wait 40 mins to be seated. The food was a huge disappointment. I think they are simply coasting on reputation and happen to have a good location. We will NOT go back.
2	neg	train	A very nice steak but if you are seeking that ultimate steakhouse experience Charley's does not cut it. I was a party of one and was seated near a corner near the kitchen. Service was friendly but slow; the waiter was apologizing to me and every table nearby that the kitchen was a little slow. Their signature salad the waiter will suggest was nothing to rave about at all; if you see some other appetizer or salad on the menu that sounds better give it a try instead. And if you are a party of one, try reserving for two and you will probably get a better table. The steak did not disappoint but all the other little things that make for a good steakhouse trip did.
2	neg	train	I waited 20 minutes before someone took my order. I then waited another 45 minutes for my food. I was there a total of 1 and !/2 hours. This was my first time. I also went another time and it was the same story. Also trying to get your drink refreshed was impossible. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
2	neg	train	Service was at a minimum! The food was just like a hundred other Mexican establishments...nothing unique here!
1	neg	train	We waited for 1 hour to get a table when they told us the wait would be only 20 minutes. The dining room is divided in two parts, the front is very nice, but they put us in back and it was horrible, very bright, nothing romantic, and very loud, we couldn't have a conversation. The food was served cold and it was not very good. It was not a very pleasant experience.
2	neg	train	I dine out at least five times a week, (a large amount of this being Asian cuisine), and have managed several restaurants. This is, buy far, the most insulting and unprofessional dining experience I have ever had. After waiting a good amount of time for the sushi appetizer to arrive, followed by another wait for the dinner, the chicken teriyaki I received with my meal was burnt tasting and inedible. The waitress did not check back until the meal was almost finished, and when she asked how everything was, I told her the chicken was no good. After giving me a rude look, and not asking if I was finished with the rest of the meal, she removed my plate. She asked me what I wanted to do about it; I told her an adjustment to the check would be fine. She returned with the bill, said nothing, and left. Nothing was adjusted with the bill; I got the waitresses attention again and asked her about the bill. She told me she told the chef/owner what I said, and he wanted to know what I wanted to do. Didn't I already tell her? Here is the part that still shocks me. The chef/owner comes over to the table to ask me what is wrong and what I would like done. I told him the chicken tasted burnt, and to adjust the bill to reflect the chicken or make another for me to take home. This is when he began his 5-minute confrontation with me. First he began to accuse me of being full and not being able to finish my meal. Then he repeatedly and emphatically tells me that he made this chicken himself and it is perfect, PERFECT! At this point I can barely contain my anger and my dining partner is in shock. He goes on to tell me I have never eaten in his restaurant before, this is how it is, and other nonsense. Finally, after staring at me blankly for almost a minute, like I am insane he walks off. The waitress come back again with a non adjusted bill and a gift certificate for $4.95; after I told him that I would definitely not be coming back to his restaurant after the way he had tread me. I paid the bill and left the certificate. Never in my life as a consumer have I been treated so poorly and rudely.
3	neg	train	Not a bad place for pizza, but the sandwhiches really aren't worth it. It's basically a take-out place. The food's decent and the prices aren't bad. Good steak sandwhich
3	neg	train	Vienna is a little more than three hours drive from the Italian border. Parts of Austria were lost to the Italians thanks to Wodrow Wilson, Versailles's peace treaty and its indignities still persist. But America will bring Wilsonian democracy to the world, just ask our friends in Iraq. So we find, went not at Poipu Beach Vacation rentals like South Shore Kauai many expression of the Italian kitchen in the former capital of the empire of the Hapsburgs. In fact, the Hapsburg kept a fleet in the Italian waters of today. The Austro-Hungarian navy gave a great report of itself. They say. In some footnote I guess. Grappino is such a footnote. I read most footnote, so I had to try this place. In my neighborhood when not at Poipu Beach, see Mypoipubeach.com, the principal attraction are tow: a very colorful presentation from the warm glow of the oversized windows and the hours, 10am to 2am, a true Italian bar. And when I visited the Italian influence was present, as the proprietor and his friend spent most of their time wooing the very attractive woman at the bar. Which is not too say the service tendered me suffered at all. I asked for and got a delightfully prepared plate of pasta with o'llio a tartufo and after a repeated request, freshly ground parmesean. I relied on the proprietor for a wine, he had no problem pouring me a turned glass of wine. As Italian wines go I thought it plausible. When on the second glass he opened a fresh bottle, I found this Sicilian red to be a very hearty and good wine. I pointed this out to my host, who unabashedly accepted there was a difference with no apology. I found this a true fault. And arrogant. Truly this was Italian, eh? I decided to take the rest of the bottle with me, a very good choice. The total bill 30 Euro. Overpriced? At 1230am? Perhaps not, but close. A return visit, certainly, I would not take a guest, with such an untrustworthy wine service. We I am starved for Pasta at Noon, and I can cross examine my host as to the age of the bottle, well then, I may go back, but how unreasonable. Too bad, a pretty venue!
2	neg	train	Although I have been there and happy in the past, I had one instance of very average food on a crowded Saturday night. And they happened to have recently changed their formula: now there' no more service, you order at the cash register and they give you a beeper - you need to pick up your food when they buzz you!... Breaks a lot of the pleasure of getting good restaurant service.
2	neg	train	"It was my birthday and I wanted the family to eat here because I thought they would like it. I had previously had fair experiences with this place before but now I will never go back. The overpriced food should at least ensure above average service. But it didn't. The waitress couldn't remember who ordered what (there were only six of us), she brought out wrong items which she couldn't make time to replace so I had to actually get the owner to replace it for me, then most of the table had to reorder after already sitting there for 20 minutes because their ""special of the day"" no longer existed, she blamed this on the cooks which it was an obvious mistake of her own, next she brought our orders out at separate times, lastly my plate was the most expensive and yet it was a very simple item to make (a stir fry vegetables with pasta plate) which I had before and just by looking at it I could tell that it was terribly over cooked. At this point I had lost my appetite with the attempt! My food tasted bland and rancid all at once. I ended up not eating much of anything and by the time I had received my food everyone else was nearly done eating and it was pointless to get them to remake my food. On top of all of this the waitress had the gall to complain about the modest tip that was left for her as a hint of ""you are not doing you job"" which I overheard her say while passing the kitchen."
1	neg	train	Greasy cold food at the buffet, bad service on drinks, odd smell almost like sewer gas in the room, wall hangings hadn't been dusted in who knows how long.
1	neg	train	Lamottes was the absolute worst experience I have ever had. We had reservations, and we had to wait for a table because they seated people without reservations. The food was terrible, the service was terrible and I would not recomend this place to anyone. The atmosphere is quite humiliating. The tables are in horrible condition and look like they were hand made by an employee. The service was horrible. The bus kids did more for us than our waitress. The silverware was dirty as well as some of our drinking glasses. I would rate this restaurant a 0 if it was an option. Do not go to this restaurant if you are looking for a pleasant dining experience.
2	neg	train	We arrived hoping to find a unique dining experience. Four hours later we were begging to go home. What started out as a presumably great idea quickly turned into a dipping nightamre. We waited as much as one-half hour between courses and had to endure a lengthy explanation of the foods, leaving us feeling emotionally spent. Paying the bill was the cliffhanger that sent us over the proverbial edge.
1	neg	train	This was the second time we have ate at this resturant. Thie first time I ordered a sandwich and it was served with the paper backing still on the cheese. The second time with the same sandwich, there was a hair sticking out of the middle of the sandwich. Then they draw you into the resturant saying kids eat free, but charge you almost $2.00 for a child's drink. I was totally dissatified with everything and they did nothing!!!!
2	neg	train	The bartender manager was unprofessional, didn't pay any attention about the customer opinions and problems with the service. For the bartenders the women specifically didn't got any idea about good customer service. They should take a training about this, because the customers pay their salaries.
1	neg	train	"Made Thanksgiving reservations for family for 2 p.m. Seated at 2:20. Received water and wine (some never received order) 2:45 ..meal arrived at 4 p.m. restaurant ran out of real turkey..ran out of yams...ran out of crackers..had to go to bar to get wine..no service....only one person got ""real"" turkey, not sure what the mystry meat was and it was covered with cold ""goo"" Desert was stacked on nearby table...three family members had to serve...finally managed to pay bill at 5 p.m. Three hours of worst food, worst service and worst dining experience we have ever encountered."
1	neg	train	"I had the worst dining experience I've ever had at LaMotte's. They claimed to be short staffed, but in reality, they weren't even capable of functioning as a restaurant. We were told upfront that they were short-handed which was fine, so we just expected to have a slow meal. Things however, went from bad to ""are you kidding me?!"" We waited an hour to receive overcooked, dried out, luke-warm crab cakes and were still missing half our sides  which we never even received by the time we finished the hockey pucks. The sides we did get looked worse than dishes taken off people's tables AFTER they've eaten. I've thrown out better looking food than some of the garnishes on our plates. To top it off, the bill was almost $200, and this started out as a lunch! (it was after 5 by the time we left) The waitress/barmaid had the nerve to act perplexed when we asked to talk to a manager. After being told to wait while she looked for a manager, and then came back, and said there was no manager in the building, we had to get up and hunt for someone of authority, to kindly take something off the check as compensation for our horrid experience. As we were negotiating, at least 2 other couples overheard our complaints, and also left...BEFORE having to endure the worst meal ever."
2	neg	train	"Everyone has always raved about this place and are willing to wait upwards of 2 hours to eat (?)We decided to try it on our way back from Ft.Laud.Very unprofessional host/seating procedure, taking random parties in large groups all at once, even though several parties were incomplete. Hostess as well as us were scolded for not following directions. Out of it's ""renowned rock shrimp"" and everything we saw good on menu and it was only 8:00. It wasn't busy. Finally settled on ribs and some variety of shrimp. Quality of what we finally received was poor as everything tasted as if it had been boiled, then thrown on a skillet. High points were the stone crab claw app and powdered-sugared hushpuppies. And people rave? Tourists?"
2	neg	train	We had Valentine's reservations for a week in advance. Upon our arrival, we were seated and the service by the waiter was unaccepatable. He dropped my fork, and never replaced it. He was hurried and running around. All the employees looked stessed out and absolutley were unaccomodating. Our order was screwed up. No one cared. I ordered Medium well and got extremely rare. It was too difficult to get our waiter's attention, and we just gave up. We have been here many times over 25 years. The service continues to decline. I plan on never returning again after this experience.
2	neg	train	The place tries to be a good restaurant based upon it's atmosphere. Tood bad the food just isn't that good. Everything tasted like smoke. Great for BBQ, bad for burritos. Plus the service was so-so. For way better food at a better price, go to Rosa's Restaurant on Mesa Dr & University. They have the best Mexican food I have ever eaten.
3	neg	train	Wonderful service, great food. Desserts a must
1	neg	train	Seriously, if this place didn't have a view of the ocean or the beach, it would be closed. Terrible food. I mean awful food. The chef probably spends more time staring at his greasy mug in a mirror. Nothing to be proud of here. Sent a purple steak back 3 times trying to get to medium. Never got there. Friends have eaten here despite warnings and have come back self-proclaimed victims.....Chef James' restaurant I'o next door is just as bad. Stick to Gerard's, Roy's Kahana (not Nicolina), David Paul's (probably the best of the group) and overlook the decor at Chez Paul and go for the filet.
1	neg	train	vitos excellence in cooking makes me speechless.one of the finest quality of food i have ever had.

3	neg	train	New Canton is a Chinese restaurant serves Dim Sum (a delicacy that touch your heart) and Cantonese style cuisine. This is not the first time that we have eaten at the New Canton. In the past, our experience with the restaurant was good but not this time. We had lunch at the restaurant today around 1:30pm. First of all, there was not a lot of selection of Dim Sum to choose from (which is not a good sign). We picked a few delicious looking Dim Sum from their Dim Sum carts. We got Pot stickers, pan fried Chives with Shrimp dumplings, and deep fried Taro root with meat stuffings. They were all served cold. If you have never had Dim Sum before, remember this, Dim Sum tastes best when it is hot. We also ordered the lunch special Lemon Chicken. It came with a soft drink and a Hot and Sour soup. The Hot and Sour soup was bad. It had no favor. I only found three ingredients in the soup which was the Tofu, the Black wood ear (a dry fungus), and the shredded Bamboo. A good Hot and Sour soup should have shredded Pork, mushroom, Black wood ear, Tofu, egg flower, and Bamboo shoots with a touch of Sesame oil and green onion. The deep fried Lemon Chicken was lukewarm and soggy with the Lemon sauce. It will be nice if the restaurant's quality is consistent.
1	neg	train	This used to be a family favorite. However, the food portions and attention to preparation have significantly decreased. The service was inadequate. Also, the manager took up a loud and abrasive argument with an employee a few feet from our table. When we commented on this, nothing was done to rectify the situation. I recommend that no one waste their time or money in such a poor dining location.
