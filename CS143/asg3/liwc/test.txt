My first experience at Joe's Crab Shack was terrible. After the head office informed me of their staffing changes, I still decided not to return (READ PREVIOUS REVIEW). That was then ... I recently returned to Joe's Crab Shack after 2 years and much to my surprise this place improved drastically. The first thing I noticed, the staff was a lot more diverse than my first experience. That manager Alan was long gone and the staff was extremely polite and a whole lot more organized. The food was good, atmosphere was great and I was happy to know that the head office did make the changes outlined in my apology letter. So, I just want to commend Joe's for living up to their promises and I will be a frequent diner at their establishment. No hard feeling :) - Brian Kim
What a fantastic place to go for an excellent meal. Everytime my family goes to Pigeon Forge we eat at the Apple Barn before we leave. The food is great the service excellent and the prices are very reasonable. Go there HUNGRY they have very large breakfast portions!
Eating here was thee shining experience for our vacation to the south. Gottlieb's Restaurant and Dessert Bar, I understand, has only been open for six months and obtained it's AAA 4 Diamond certification in under 4 months. The service alone made us utterly speechless. Each of our courses were brought to us through precise and fluid choreography that, as our charming bread girl informed us, is planned very seriously behind-the-scenes. The result is amazing and made us feel like royalty. Dinner began with perfectly prepared cocktails brought to us by the same said charming girl and served with a genuine smile. After an impromptu and brief interview we learned she is working on a novel, and after conversing with other staffmembers we found Gottlieb's to employ an extremely talented and ambitious bunch of articulate and intelligent people, who weren't however native to Savannah. Nevertheless, as our charming girl took great pride in telling us, the executive chefs Laurence and Michael grew up in Savannah, returning from an extensive cooking r~{(&~}sum~{(&~} that includes The Little Inn at Washington to continue a family legacy of food in Savannah. The Gottlieb's name has a rich history in the name of baking, and the latest generation has evolved the family business into a breathtaking fine dining establishment peopled with a fine and impeccably trained staff. Our meal began with bread from 'generations-old recipes' that disappeared from our plates as quickly as our charming novelist could replace it, along with a little extra amus~{(&~} from the kitchen that was announced as a Dainty Tid Bit. I had a fluffy butter lettuce salad as my husband enjoyed foie gras and he was reluctant to surrender a single bite to me. It was velvet to the tongue, pure decadence. The first course was removed in a timely and well-choreographed manner and our charming novelist even replaced our dirty silverware and a napkin that I hadn't even noticed had fallen to the floor. Her attention to detail really made us feel cared-for. In time, our main courses were set before us with the grace and ease of a ballet. I had the Rabbit at our server's request and I thank him for it still. As the charming novelist was ensuring our water glasses were full, I questioned the sauce the rabbit leg was braised in. There was a certain sweetness that I couldn't indentify, to which I was delighted and surprised to find out the homemade sauce included brown sugar and granny smith apples amongst other things. How inventive and how completely successful. My husband agreed whole-heartedly, spooning much of my rabbit onto his Duck. And the Duck! The ducks are called Long Island Peking Ducks and are slow roasted, stuffed with 'mirepoix' and herbs. And by slow-roasted, they mean cooked for about six hours, so you can imagine how incredibly tender it was! With all of the information our young server assistant made available to us regarding the restaurant history and menu, we wonder where she finds the time to write! It seems that the staff must spend all their free-time pouring over all things Gottlieb's. For being open just six months, one must wonder how long before the place opened they spent training their expert staff. Ah, but then onto dessert!! Our charming novelist (who apparently wears many hats refilling water, breadplates, assisting in clearing our plates and stealthily replacing our silverwares) brought over an entire cart filled with confections not to be found on the already extensive dessert menus. Each cake and tort came with a mouthwatering description that was delivered stunningly. How DO they remember everything?! When we asked her for her personal favorite, she gushed, "Oh, madame, the Warm Valhrona Chocolate Cake!" and launched into such an adorable and spirited description that we simply could not turn her down! I ordered decaffeinated coffee which I was pleased to learn was organically grown in Virginia and decaffeinated using the swiss water method, which until then I had no concept of but I can surely tell you that I have asked for in every restaurant since. I hadn't thought of it before but most decaffeinated coffees are done so by means of a heavy chemical process. The Swiss Water method 'charges the beans with water, allowing them to circulate in the coffee flavor', which, by god, makes for AMAZING coffee. Our husband asked if we could take the girl home with us! Our fine server presented us with the send-off, Savannah's coveted chocolate chewies, and, of course, the damage. Which for the atmosphere, service excellence, and incredible edibles, was an elegant bargain. Well done, Gottlieb's Restaurant and Dessert Bar.
Was ultimatly the best experience that we've ever had. The service was excellent and the food was to die for, especially the braised duck. It was a little sweet but the meat was tender and absolutly amazing. To top it off, dessert was the best part of the meal. My suggestion, take your coffee and dessert into the J-Bar, it's unlike any experience we've ever had.
Over all a good time and good food and a wonderful view. We ate lunch here which I think was the best value. Good service to boot!!
Casual dining for breakfast, lunch and dinner-- excellent special in a laidback NOT rowdy) college atmosphere. Great sandwiches, omelettes and light entrees-- try the specials too.
Cafe Ba Ba Reeba has been around for a long time in Chicago, but just recently opened in Las Vegas. They serve tapas, which originated in Spain as a way to serve small portions of food to keep patrons happy and get them to drink more. Cafe Ba Ba Reeba changed all that by making the dishes the focus of the experience, serving plates of food that are exquisite. The smaller portions allowed us to order several things, which we passed around and oohed and aahed with each bite. I don't think I have ever eaten such a fabulous array of food that was so expertly prepared. The chicken curry was outstanding, a creamy curry sauce and chicken served chilled. I loved the Kobe beef short ribs, a treat at around ten dollars. Most of the dishes are around five dollars, so you can get quite a selection of different meals for very little money. I especially liked the Desserts, we had three! The chocolate truffle was incredible, as was the lemon tart and the caramel bananas. They really pay attention to detail here, a great dining experience. Everyone can find several things they will like, regardless of whether they are picky eaters or real adventurous, and the wait staff is very helpful at helping you decide what to get. I highly recommend this place to anyone going to Vegas.
Fabulous Food and the New Times of Phoenix gave it a great review
This has to be some of the best, most authentic, Italian food ever! I had the Canelloni Donatello. It was stuffed with Veal and Ricotta Cheese and coved in light cream and tomato sauces. The pasta itself was amazingly tender. Light pressure on the fork and, like a hot knife through butter, slid easily through. It was obvious that the pasta was hand made, then cooked after (yes, AFTER) I ordered. And the taste? Lucious!!! The waiters, who were highly attentive, almost had to pick me up off the floor, because I nearly melted from sensory overload. If you are ever in Tampa, go to Donatello. It's a little expensive, but OH is it worth it!
The very top of cooking. Probably the best restaurant of northern Italy. A top class food, service and atmosphere. Expensive but worth any buck you spend.
Chef Pat is one of the world's great undiscovered chefs. Born in Paris, Mould prepares classic Cajun French cuisine that makes you want to slap your Mama AND your grandma! Try his Mac Choux (corn based dish) and any of his seafood fettucine's. A "not to be missed" experience when visiting Cajun Louisiana.
Along with several lifelong friends we traveled to Platte City on a stormy Friday night. We found not only a wonderful menu selection and wonderfully presented food, but had an experience that will keep us talking for years. We were greeted as though we were family members, and by the end of the evening we felt like we had known the owners for years. The shrimp appetizer with blue cheese was served in a blue stemmed glass in such an attractive way that I didn't want to disturb it. It was so good that I would have had it as my main course if that had been offered. Instead I had the pork loin in plum sauce. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. All of our meals were great. The service was first rate too. At the end of the evening we viewed pictures of the reconstruction of the property, and our server even sang a song for us. We passed on dessert only because we had a surprise birthday cake back home for one of our friends. But it hurt to look at the choices without getting to sample them. I'm sure we will be back.
Best restaurant in Florence. The black bean soup is amazing. The blue cheese dressing is amazing. Specials are usually great (particularly potato-crusted salmon). Usually good tunes piped in too. Highest recommendation.
I've been to Atomic Cafe three times, and it has not disappointed on any occassion. Ths is the type of place that is good to regale friends, entertain an out-of-town guest, or take a date to. The food is unique and very good, the bar is well stocked, and in the summer, the patio with live music is one of the very best places to see and be seen.
The food was vary vary I had the chile relleno that was vary good just like mom made them. my wife got the chile verde burrito it was made to melt in your mouthe thay also have jr size burritos for the little ones overall I wood go back for wich the atmosphere and experience was vary pleasant they also make the 6 foot and smaller party burritos.
This is the best place I've been to since Little Italy in NYC. I can't wait to return! They have Sandabs to DIE for!
The service was excllent and the atmosphere was wonderfull. They had a Local artists art work up and a giant Alice in wonderland mural up. The price was good for the food 6.95 for crabcakes and grilled salmon.
The Garden Court Restaurant offers one of the best, if not the best, brunch in the San Francisco Bay area. The brunch is offered every Sunday at a cost of around 45 dollars per person, however four time during the year Mother's day, Easter, New Year's and Christmas the Garden Court offers their Grand Buffet at 85 dollars per adult, and 50 for children and they usally sell out. I can say first hand it is a dazzling, meticulously presented selection of hot and cold dishes range from dim sum dumplings, carved-to-order Lamb, Cakes and pies, omelets made to order not to mention the more traditional eggs Benedict, Belgian waffles, warm biscuits and smoked salmon, something to please almost every taste. If you are a resident or a tourist get on the phone and make reservations at the Garden Court ASAP, you will not be disappointed.
Every visit to this restaurant has been better than the one before. It's a busy place and you may have to wait 1/2 hour to be seated but it's worth it! The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great. A couple of men playing spanish songs on their acoustic guitars makes for a very nice authentic Mexican meal. I will say that this is not a place where people who want a quiet meal should go. Most of the time it's hustling with activity. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VERY MEXICAN RESTAURANT!
Food here is always excellent- the Best Steaks in Kansas City and we have tried them ALL. Great service and atmosphere, and they take reservations! Gilbert's is especaiily great for any special occasion - tell them in advance if it's a birthday or aniversary; they will give the table one free dessert and put confetti on the table cloth, etc. Fun place, also great for romance....the fireplace is beautiful and the martinis are just huge.
For being a brand new restaurant,in restaurant competitive Atlanta,we found the food in this restaurant,specially the pizza outstanding!Definitely authentic southern Italian.Insalata Caprese(my favorite)was served the way(or almost)they serve it in Italy,nothing fancy like The Caprese in other restaurants.Fried Calamari were real tasty,but a bit salty.The ambiance is not very cozy,but the place is new.Our waiter was Italian and was very nice.Prices were not bad at all.We are definitely going back very soon.
I love this place!! The people there are so friendly and the food is to die for. The price is so cheap and I can't believe I was so full for the price I'd paid.
We were pleased with the friendly service. The food was wonderful, and very reasonably priced. The bread and pastas were homemade, and the difference is appreciable when compared to other places. The thin crust pizza was the best, as was the lasagna. You can tell only fresh ingredients are used - the flavors are exquisite.
The best Peanut Butter Pizza I have ever had!!! Great service, enjoyed! Will be back again!
My older family members have been going to Sweatman's for years. It was just good local BBQ to them. When we finally went a few years ago it was fabulous, definitely the best I've ever had in SC. (you add your own sauce) Only open on Fri and Sat and they take 1 month off per year in the summer- when the locals starve to death! It's worth the 1.5 hour drive for us. Special note: first commers get to go back through the line twice (they'll ask you if you've ever been there before). Regulars have to pile it on high the first time. The ribs are just as fabulous as the BBQ and it's all included, I believe less than $ 6 !!! Have fun!
Great food and service, lovely decor and very reasonable prices!
Ken's has the best Steak in Oklahoma. The menu is limited to Prime rib, 8oz. or 12oz. Steak, ribs, and I believe Chicken, with a choice of French fries, baked potatoe, and a Salad bar visit, with fried okra and brown beans. Ken is always there and is always harassing (joking with) someone. The restraunt is open at 4:30 p.m on Thurs. Fri. and Sat. evenings. I would recommend Ken's to everyone. You'll go back.
Even if you're just passing through, this is a must stop! Its located in the Foothills just outside of Yuma. This is a small, family run place, and the food is nothing short of amazing. I urge you to order anything with carne asada in it. Everytime we eat there, its hard to decide between the burrito or the torta. Make sure to say hi to Jason & Lynda! Thanks for the great food guys!!
With the huge influx of Filipino workers to Ireland particularly in the health industry, I was not surprised to read that a Filipino restaurant was established somewhere in Dublin. I told my husband that we have got to go and sample the food on our next trip to Ireland. And so we did. We ordered the usual Chicken Adobo and was quite surprised that the taste and texture of the dish was not quite what we're used to. It was very good but just different (it could be a regional thing). I was really impressed with the chicken with coconut milk as well, it certainly has a lot of Thai influence in it. The dessert selection however, needs to be reviewed. The Philippines has an extensive list of desserts and they should consider introducing them to the Irish. The service was impeccable and the trio, Tropical Storm created such a vibrant and fun atmosphere. I will definitely come back to this restaurant and I am glad my countrymen are doing well so far away from home.
Located in the heart of Orlando's growing "little Saigon" district, this restaurant is considered by local Vietnamese & Americans to be one of the best. On any given day, you will find over half the clientele to be of Asian descent  a good sign  many of whom order specialty items not on the menu! The menu can be lengthy and intimidating, but take your time and ask for help. Food is always fresh. The have the best Summer (Four Season) rolls in town. They have the obligatory soups (in huge bowls), rice vermicelli and rice dishes, but they do it better than most.
Dale's Pizza in Thorne Bay, Alaska opened in May of 2001. The majority of the ingredients are home made and the attention to detail combine to make this pizza one of the best around. This year BBQ ribs were added as well as hot wings. The ribs are just about as good as it gets, as well. Real food, real people, real good......
What a wonderful restaurant with excellent food. They serve huge portions with the price very inexpensive.
Wait staff highly knowledgable. Recommended wines which complemented the many dishes our party ordered. Our waiter did not even use a notepad!! He remembered everything without fail. The food was fresh, delicious, authentic and came very quickly. WOW!! What impresses me the most is that the restaurant and lounge appeared to be very very busy and everyone was happy and enjoying themselves. REMARKABLE. We love the area and as soon as we get back we most certainly will return to the Black Forest.
A great deli, serving authentic subs. Great soups and salads for the price. Best in town!
Outstanding people with great food and service. You get a real good sense of small-town, everybody-knows-everybody type atmosphere that will make you come back time and again. We make at least two annual flights from Stillwater to Chickasha just to see Ken and the gang. Ken even came to pick us up from the airport!
GREAT WINGS!!!! I have reorranged business trips so that I could stop in and have a helping or two of their wings. If you are anywhere near Buffalo or Lancaster, you should stop in and try the wings. David
can be described as best meal of my life - or one of the top 5 - even with having to make reservations a month out well worth it - great service i got to tour the the kitchen - rifled thru the walk in - -we even got an extra entree - all in all great restaurant
Despite the name, this should not really be in the "Mexican" category... there is simply nothing like it. It is truly California-southwest-fusion-seafood-stuff, and no superlatives are adequate to describe it. The place is about one step short of "dump", maybe "beach diner", in the most charming way. There is an ocean view, and the clientele is mostly eclectic upscale student beach cognoscenti scum. Get the picture? I thought not... this is a place that cannot be pigeon-holed, and the food is out of this world. Try the ono if it's in season... and the green stuff they drizzle over plates!! If this outfit ever franchises and goes public, I'm in. The best kept secret in Morro (then, so is Morro in a way) and a truly unique dining experience. Go there. Do it. This is some of the best eating on the west coast. Seriously.
J Gilberts is one of our favorite places for dinner. We love the decor and particularly like to sit near the fireplace. Our service has always been friendly and efficient. The presentation is attractive and the food is always cooked perfectly. The servings are large and seem generous for the price. We dine here at least once a month and take all of our out of town company here to enjoy a great steak.
Most buffets style restaurants don't quite get it, Todai is not one of those, they have perfected the service down to a science. I dropped a napkin on the floor and counted, one one thousand two one thousand three... the napkin was gone and a new one appeared. This is a new Todai, so the crowds are similar to standing in line while reading the sign at Disneyland that says one hour from this point, but the food is well worth the wait, so standing in line becomes a necessary evil. They serve everything from Sushi to Soup and baked lobster in between. The Floor manager Steven Lee was very helpful and all the staff went above and beyond to help make my dining experience one to remember. If you get a chance look for a Todai in your city and get ready for the experience of your life. For partys over 6, reservations are recommended, everyone else is on a walk in basis. One more important note, not one time did I return to my seat and my used plate staring back at me,the service is just that good!
So fun!! Incredible food! Love the back to the basic Italian menu. I loved the Lemon Chicken and my friend had Veal Pamagiana (?) and he is still raving about the authentic NY style "gravy" I call marinara. The staff was great. They obviously love their jobs and have fun. So was it the wine or did we just experience a bit of heaven??
Great food and service-will return often
Graat food and great prices. The Firehouse on Arlington Rd is closest to our house , but we have been to one in Barberton too. The crab legs and the dessert wraps that Chef Rick invented are out of this world!!
Le Cafe' is located on the second floor of the five star Royal Hotel Hsinchu. I met at the entrance by a smiling hostess and quickly seated even though it was the lunch rush hour. In the month of December this facility serves an average of 20,000 guest. Upon being seated I couldn't help noticing how beautifully everything was presented. In a buffet style setting each dish was a feast for the eye. I started out with a Lotus Root salad served cold and crunchy with just a hint of vinegar, along with serving of Glass noodle and cucumber salad, which was spicey hot. For the entree I decided I might as well try alittle of everything. I wasnt disappointed I had chose to endulge. The stuffed Lamb wrapped in cabbage, Fish in chard Frond and Thai Red Curry sauce were simply delicious. The waiter and waitress were always close at hand to see to my every need. Dessert- I had the Fabulous Black Forrest cake and coffee that was perfect. The staff conducted themselves very professionally and were more than courteous. The restaurant was clean spacious and comfortable. I was so completely satisfied with every aspect of this meal that I have since returned and dined there nine additional times. If you are looking for simple elegance, come to Le Cafe' and meet Executive Chef Gordon Tai and his gracious staff. Its a place you want to be.
great time -wonderful coal fired tasting pizza - exceptional service!!!
The staff was great and they made our experience wonderful. The food was fabulous, the chef knows what he's doing!! We were seated promptly, even though they were busy, I will definitely return.
In over 8 years of living in Washington DC, City Lights of China continues to be among my favorite restaurants to take family and friends. The service is quick and crisp, although it should be noted that the staff is best for its efficiency rather than small talk. The food is the best Chinese food that I have tasted, and is notable for its vegetarian and seafood offerings. Unbelievably, the prices remain moderate despite the restaurant's incredible popularity. A must visit for all visiting Washington's Dupont Circle area! I am glad to recommend it.
I am a repeat customer, and am never disappointed! Best Margarita I've ever had!! Food is fabulous each and every time. I have been sending wedding parties, groups, etc. I love it!!
went there to celbrate a friends birthday after hearing about the place from a friend who had been there. must say this, the food, service and the ambience are fantastic. they've turned an old 19th century home into one of nicest places i've seen in the city in ages. a separate cozy wood floored bar, an awesome typical spanish blue tiled lounge with a little water body in the center with floating candles and flowers...and then the dining room is a pleasure...high ceilinged with nice simple tables and these lovely blue stemmed wine glasses...it was an evening to remember. especially the owner..forget his name now, but young fair guy...regaled us with stories about the history of tapas and his experiences in barcelona and with spanish chefs and then came the surprise...a deep rich chocolate cake for my friens who's birthday it was, with complements from the owner...when we asked him how he knew..he just winked and said it's my job to know... all in all...a great experience...we've been back 4 times now and each time he has new stories to tell us and always remembers what each of us had to drink...it's a really great place...check it out and i'm sure u'll echo my feelings about caliente... and don't forget to try their apple sangria...it's to die for...
A very relaxing atmosphere. The service is fantastic. People are friendly. Food takes some time but is well worth the wait. Money well spent. I left full and satisfied will return agian. Definately recomend.
This is probably the best meal I have had since I moved to Charlotte four years ago. I lived in downtown chicago for ten years and this restaurants rivals some of the best meals I had while in chicago. I highly, highly recommend this fabulous restaurant!
I love this place! They've got great food and friendly service! The best is the absolutely delicious BOTTOMLESS chai and someone went around just to make sure your cup was always filled. Cedars has the best curry I've ever tasted! In fact, I'm going there again...TONIGHT! :o9
WOW!!! This is Charlotte's newest tapas restaurant! I has only been open for 1 week. It is part of the following group ( Mimosa Grill, Harper's, Upstream). The lunch menu converts to dinner at 3 pm. The dinner selections have more variety than lunch. We had soups, fried goat cheese, broiled oysters, red snapper and a molten chocolate cake for lunch. What an awesome experience!!! The wine list is extensive and they offer you shot of the wine prior to ordering your bottle. Go to this restaurant now, as soon, when word gets out, you will not be able to get a table!
I stumbled onto this restaurant about 6 years ago and have been back several times since. I live in Seymour - well over an hour away, but it's always worth the trip. I've tried many menu items but nothing can compare to their andouee sausage appetizer and crawfish etouffe entree. It's a wonderful change. If you have an experienced waiter/waitress who has a minute to spend talking, ask about the owner/chef's culinary history - it's fascinating!
Love the Atmosphere. I eat out about 2 or 3 Times a week I been coming to Bloomington on Business for about 4 months every week and I have found the Greatest Food and Service ever!!!! The 12 oz PRIME Strip Steak is the Best Steak in Town. And the Smashed Potatoes are to die for. You have to have their famous Skillet Cookie Great Price!! A Must See
This is the most happening place in all of Fort Mill. People pack in every day to get their share of the cheap, but worthwhile food. Not only is there super service, but after lunch people can go and enjoy a nice cone of CHEAP ice cream. It is the best in FORT MILL!!!
This is the most beautiful and by far best Portuguese/Spanish restaurant in the Newark's Ironbound section. It is very romantic, the food is excellent and the staff is very friendly. It was highly recommended and I would say the same. Check out their site for a virtual tour www.adegagrill.com, if you're in the area it's a must go.
Despite the fact that every restaurant reviewed here gets a 5, this is one that actually deserves it. Every single one of your senses is satisfied by the time you leave. It doesn't get much better than that. I think its part of a recent trendy (yuppie) fascination with arabian hookah bars, but its still the coolest restaurant I've ever been to. First of all, you get to sit on the floor surrounded by comfy pillows and watch an occasional belly dance that's reminiscent of the opening to 'I dream of Genie'. Its tasteful. The prices are good for the excellent middle eastern food. You'll leave having spent maybe $50 for 5 or 6 people including the hookah and dessert (its also vegetarian friendly) and at the end of the day, you get to smoke from hugely ornate (and authentic) hookahs or sip ridiculously strong Turkish coffee. All in all I guarantee you one of the best dining experiences you'll ever have. Try the mint tobacco.
We went for breakfast, and it was fantastic. They are very kid-friendly - the kids get wiki sticks to play with and keep them occupied. The breakfast sausage are huge and very lean/ The belgian waffle had fresh fruit and freshly whipped cream, and the fruit cup had quite a large variety of fruits.
This is the best Chinese place I have ever eaten. They are the only people who have a meat dish with tons of veggies and is spicy.
You would never think that a sports bar would have gourmet food but Carmine's does!! He even serves osso bucco on some nights as his special, as well as an all you can eat rib night. I swear this place is so good, and their stromboli is FANTASTIC! iIlove their pastas as awell. Athough they call it pink sauce, the tomato cream sauce is also really good. You can't go wrong here.
This place was really cool. The atmosphere was calm and fun. I really enjoyed it tremendously and will continue to go there more often.
The Best ever had in the county, of course we had to try because of hear say of 5 star casual dining restaurant. So we all went and enjoyed the best ever in prime and seafood. Especialy the pan walleye which is a preciouse meal by it self, would love to get the recipe for that.
This restaurant is hidden in the back corner of the restaurants section of the Stratopshere. It's worth the trip. The plates were only around 15 and under per person. The food a little salty, but in all very good. The portions were large and would fill up most anyone. The service was fantastic. The man was at our table every second we needed something. They didn't have to ask who got what dish, and at the end of the meal the waiter even came out with a crumb catcher to clear the places. The inside is beautiful. They have artwork all over the walls (not paintings in frames). I get the impression it was all hand done, also. =)
Great food at inexpensive prices.
Fabulous lamb chops, and the house red cabernet wine went great with the lamb! This "spot", pardon the pun, is a must stop for anyone on their way to, or on the way back from anywhere! For an unassuming place, this restaurant serves outstanding food, with outstanding service, and a bartender who really understands how to make a true Manhattan! (that's burboun + sweet vermouth + maraschino cherry!)
Best Crabs ever!!!
This is one of best places to go for a great meal in Northeast Ohio. After five you will want to make reservations or expect to wait (up to an hour on weekends). The service is quite personable but can be a little slow at times. The food flavors meld together excellently and servings are plentiful, especially for the price. About the only draw-back is that often the atmosphere is more in keeping with that of a crowded family restaurant.
ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO EAT IN AUGUSTA.
Dining here was an absolute joy, made all the more exciting by the fact that I had taken leave of my senses earlier in the day whilst listening to the crotch-tuppingly rocking album "David Sings America" by the great Duvet Humptyshuft. I had the Baywatch Burger, which was pleasantly meaty but not as great as The Hot Shot City Cocktail which was particularly good..
Extremely enjoyable
Everything here is extraordinary -- the cakes, desserts, cookies -- the Tiramasu we ordered for New Year's Day was the best any of our 30 guests had ever tried anywhere, including NY, Italy, etc. Even the owners are extraordinary -- creative, friendly and professional!
This place was amazing. First of all for a sports bar, there were over 50 TVs with every sport imaginable on. In fact their motto was "If its not on at the Beer Hunter, its not on" Then the food. Huge portions, none of us were able to finish our meal. A full bar provided everyone in the group with their favorites. Wine, Cocktails, and over 150 beers. The service was great. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone.
Friday might seafood buffet was out of this world. There was something for everyone. Especially good,were the multiple salads with only the freshest ingredients.Oysters on the half shell, crab legs, salmon dishes, and excellent sushi are only a few entrees available. The dessert bar was made in heaven. A white chocolate cheesecake caught my attention. Staff was prompt & courteous. Surely a must go to when in Reno.
I had a great time there the service and food was great
What a wonderful place! Everyone is friendly and having a good time, customers and employees. We arrive on Saturday night not knowing what do expect. We were greeted by our server who was more than happy to answer any questions we had about the menu. I chose the lobstermania - Wow! Little did we know that they had live entertainment on Saturday Nights. The band was great - playing classic rock from the 80's and 90's. Can't wait to go back in the summer and enjoy their outdoor deck. I've been telling everyone about it!
One of Emeril Lagasse's sites. Due to his large cult following and AWESOME food, this restaurant is often booked 3 months in advance! Do not be surprised if you can only get a 9 pm or later reservation. Now to the good stuff---- A very impressive polynesian cocktail list complete with signature rums, fruit juices and umbrellas. Must try dishes--- Tuna Poke, Spring Rolls, any fish special of the day. You will not be disappointed!
Out standing ,hot new place ,Hip,cool ,fresh and ambiant relaxing surounding. This is not you usual old stale Restaurant but a hip new place that the name alone says its life. The food was AWSOME great Italian food and a large selection of other options such as seafood and steak. Our group enjoyed this place so much that we have made a reservation for next week. Amust try.
GREAT! the food is to die for (especially the deep-fried pickles). the big mouth coors lite...big plus and its always ICE COLD!
I go to Padovani's maybe once a month on average and have never had a bad experience. The wine bar upstairs is a treat - cozy, good menu + you can also order from the entire restaurant menu - and the wine by the glass selection is the best in Honolulu. The prices are also surprisingly reasonable. Downstairs in the restaurant, you do have to be prepred for slower service than you might expect, but imo it's never bad service, and the wine list is again very good. It's considerably more expensive than the wine bar but you can linger and enjoy. The setting is different than most around here, and is a nice change. Alone among fine dining on Oahu, Padovani's has an entire separate vegetarian menu that they give when you ask if an item is vegetarian. I think this place is underrated. Although you can run up quite a check here, you can also just go & enjoy good food & wine without waiting for a special occasion or a time when you don't mind spending a lot.
I was visiting from San Diego and my father told me about the place... It was amazing...When I come back Joe Grate's will be the first place I'll go to.....
Very cute, homey restaurant. Great food, great service!!
Ribs were done to perfection. Tender and moist, very flavorful, with a choice of 4 different sauces. I will knock you out of the way to back in there..... Great service...I will return and return
The only thing worse than the food was the service. The service and the noise. The service, the noise and the pretentiousness of valet parking in a strip mall with ample public parking directly adjoining the place. The service, the noise, the pretentions...oh, forget it - the food is bad enough to warrant first place on our 'Never Again' list..
If I had to sum up my dining experience at Riccardo's with one word it would have to be "Orgasmic" The food was simply the best I have had in a very long time. Whether you speak of the breads, salads, soup, or collection of confections, each course was a culinary treat. Our entrees of shrimp and salmon in garlic sauce and rosemary chicken were delicioso. The only thing to surpass the food would have to be Sergio, our waiter. With his constant attention to our every need he brought an authentic and warm satisfactory glow to this evening. His professionalism to just make us feel welcome was only matched by his attentive service and special talents. He could be truly described as Chef's Russo's greatest asset. So spoil yourself, fly away tonight on the wings of an epicurean delight. Imbibe in something decadently delicious or just pop in for quick cannelloni you will swear came from the gods.
The food, service and atmosphere were all excellent. I ordered the blackened chicken with the blackened crabcake on top. Everything tasted wonderful. The appetizers were also tasty, especially the coconut shrimp. The bananas foster for dessert was to die for! The only thing I didn't like was the fact that I had 3 starches on my plate, mashed potatoes, corn, and rice. I would have much rather had rice or potatoes and a green vegetable. Other than that, everything was excellent.
The best ribs I've ever had. Expect to wait awhile during tourist season, but well worth the wait. They'll ship them to you also.
It is decorated to look like a beatnik coffee house from the 'fifties. For some people, that might be funky. But for people of my age, it brings back nostalgia. The food is just self-serve, fast food. But the atmosphere is unique, if you want to step back in time. A good place to shoot a film set back then.
Excellent service, family friendly yet upscale, fun explanations where needed (wine opener), reasonable prices of quality food, encouraged us to stay and continue our visit . . . we are returning next month !
The Salt Lick is one of my 5 favorite places to eat in the entire world, no question. As a native Texan and a male, the opportunity for all-you-can-eat barbecue is nothing short of divine. The food is delicious, and it's a great time to sit around in a big group, fighting over who gets the first round of ribs and who gets to take home the last round leftovers. Hook 'em!
We had the most fantastic seafood. The langoustine which are like a large dublin bay prawn were fresh and succulent, the guy that caught them actually came into the hotel with them still alive straight off the boat. My friends steak was wonderful a fabulous rib eye that was tender and cooked just as ordered. The desserts were out of this world, typically Scottish, cranachan, cream, oatmeal, raspberries and drambuie, Scottish clootie dumpling, light and fruity. The dining room was light by candlelight, two wonderful roaring fires all in an old building that dates back to the 1500's. We enjoyed the meal so much that we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant all three nights we stayed. All the meals were fantastic from local venison to crab. I would recommend going to The Lodge Hotel to stay or eat, if you ever get a chance to visit The Isle of Skye, we are going to go back!
This is some of the best Barb-Q in the United States. I've had Barb-Q in many places including Memphis, Texas, etc. This is clearly some of the best. Don't forget to have a malt.
I like Hunan Gourmet very much. It is a relaxed atmosphere with great food. Some of the other local Asian restaurants try to make the dishes too complicated. Hunan Gourmet offers consistent, great meals. I enjoy their seafood as well as their classic chinese dishes. Their Peking Duck and General Tsou's Chicken is some of the best I have ever had.
no waiting to eat, service was great but the food, excellent, best I have had out in a long time.
I've dined at Palmira's several times. Sometimes as a family with my husband and two boys. Other times with other couples. The service and food is great and it's a beautiful space in a beautiful neighborhood. They have a great selection of wines. It is incredibly "kid friendly" both in the menu selections and in the open attitude towards children. The desserts are to die for. I'm addicted to the Ricotta Kisses! Go! You won't regret it. Oh! The pizzas are great too.
After waiting for an hour, which seemd much less, we were treated to great service and wonderful food at a very good value!
The St. John's Restaurant in Chattanooga, TN, has been my favorite fine dining establishment for several years. I have eaten there many times for business and pleasure in the past 3 years and not once has there been even the hint of disappointment. The food is superb... traditional steaks, seafood and fowl, but always several more adventurous choices. The service staff is fabulous but never intrusive. The wine and liquor selections leave nothing to be desired. If you are looking for the finest restaurant in Chattanooga, and certainly one of the very best places at which I have ever eaten, regardless of location or price, then visit The St. John's!
The Tenderest Ribs in the World, Also the largest. You can get anything of the Texas B B Q in this resturant... I stop there every time I get a chance......All that I can say is WOW !!!!!!!!
The perfect place on restaurant row, the one day I walk up restaurant row and I discover this gem of a restaurant. Living in N.Y. I do not go to restaurant row because most of the restaurants are cheap ,touristy and run with no warmth. this place M.S. stands out as the best to me in food,service and warmth. I will go back again and again.
Wonderful bistro! We were delighted to find that everything we had heard about Buca was true. The sauces are outstanding and the second time we went, the menu had changed completely. We asked, and were told they change it four times a year! The host told us a story about the wine and let us sample it because it is poured by the glass. Great service. If you are travelling to the Bay Area, make sure you try this hidden gem. If you live in the area - lucky you.
Just won ton is a hole in the wall. All be it the best hole in the wall I have ever eaten in. There is no atmosphere, but the food is great! You will be hard pressed to spend $5 per person. Everything that I have had at Just won ton has been above all expectations. Ask about MSG, it's in the soup, if your allergic. There is a big chinese seafood restaurant on the corner, but don't be fooled, their food is crap at 5 times the price. They closes over Xmas for a week every year. You can not do better for great food at no cost.
Excellent food. Would travel to OKC again for it!!
An excellent place for a lunch or fine diner. Everything is top notch!!!
This reataurant is an intimate place where you can have a lovely romatic dinner or strike up a conversation with other interesting diners. We got a great tip from a local on a canoe guide for doing the Alagash wilderness area in addition to a wonderful dinner. L'Auberge will be featured soon in "Gourmet" magazine. It is located in picturesque Bethel, Maine which is near the white mountains a great place to ski. treat yourself to wonderful food, deligthful surrounding and a superb staff.
Owned by the same amazing family that runs Crustacean, but Thanh Long is by far our favorite for an all-out luxurious meal. The Roast Crab is a delectable experience (especially if you get your own! We usually share) and the garlic noodles are an absolute must. Start off the meal with one of their signature fru-fru drinks, and enjoy the mango salad (never to be replicated!) and/or the calamari appetizer... put on the plastic bibs and await the grand entrance of your main course! At $30-40/pp it's not a bargain meal by any means, but there are a few bargain knockoffs in the Richmond & Sunset districts, but they do not even come close to Thanh Long! Though it is a drive out to the outer Sunset, we prefer Thanh Long to Crustacean, as Crustacean just doesn't have the same atmosphere... and the neighborhood has easy parking too! Enjoy!
When you walk thru the front door you instantly feel like you have just gotten home from a long journey. A very comfortable setting with something smelling great on its way to you. The service was the way it was back when people took care of other people. It was truly a special night for my wife and I.
Great place, excellent food, innovative drinks and punches, excellent service
Definitely an exquisite restaurant. Set in the middle of La Plata by the railroad tracks that run thru the town- hence the name. The menu has a wide array of choices to please everyone(I suggest the prime rib).The atmosphere is very nice and the service remarkable.A bar in a separate area from the restaurant has that Irish Pub appeal. You and your tastebuds will walk away extremely pleased.
This Place is great, a "must visit" if you are in the Spartanburg, SC area. It won the Blue Ribbon for best burger joint in the south recently from Turner South tv channel. Craig is all wet, must work for McDonalds or something
We dine here weekly. This is, in my opinion, the BEST Italian restaurant in the city. The southern Italian cuisine is cooked carefully, and consistantly, every time I've been there. The gravy is wonderful (we are very picky about our gravy :-). The gravy has to be good for us to return. They have a lobster special every Wednesday. It's a HUGE tail prepared to perfection. The meals come with soup, salad, bruschetta, and pizza bread. The wine list is very long, with expensive and moderate choices. The atmosphere is dark, which is very relaxing after a long day at the office. But in addition to regular seating, they have alcoves, which block out all surrounding noise in the restaurant. They are very romantic and private. MY FAV!
Fantastic dinner. Try the caesar salad, mashed potatoes and any of the steaks. don't bother ordering the bernaise or any of the sauces, you won't need them. The steaks melt in your mouth.
At Corky's the waitresses will come to your car, or serve you at one of their large, round, orange picnic tables. Family favorites are the pork tenderloin sandwiches, broasted potatoes, and large mugs of root beer. Corky's is only open from spring till fall, but a visit to Allegan isn't complete without lunch at Corky's.
The Black Bear Diner is like no other diner, you can tell from the moment you enter the restaurant and see the cool bear theme. The menus are printed on a 1927 edition of a newspaper apparently sponsored by the Carmel Pine Cone, a local newspaper which is owned by a couple of close personal friends of mine, Paul Miller and Kirstie Wilde. The Black Bear philosophy has six credos, number 4 states: "If you don't say. "WOW", when your food arrives, you either ordered toast, or my chef had a flashback to the days when they were working somewhere else" (I paraphrased that). To tell you the truth, I had no intention of saying "Wow", when my food arrived, but guess what, I did!! I had no choice, The Black Bear Diner offers such large portions. They don't skimp on the portions or the flavor, there was no doggie bag needed, at least, in my case I cleaned my plate. The Black Bear Diner serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, now that I know about the Black Dear Diner, I shall return.
This is a great, friendly restaurant right on the Main Street in Stroudsburg, The food is always good, and lots of it! The burgers are huge! The soups are very good and the food is always hot! They have a full bar and even have their own beer on tap. We have gone there for lunch also. The service is great and the prices are very reasonable.
GREAT food at reasonable prices. The only potato salad I've come close to liking as much as mom's. Service is a bit lacking / unprofessional with the younger / newer staff, but not too bad. [As an aside, if the previous reviewer perhaps didn't give a 2 year old a plate of fries to keep dropping on the floor, or maybe even cleaned up after their child, I'm sure ALL restaurant owners would appreciate it. Personally, I very much dislike having to walk near areas like that and step all over food because of a family being discourteous to everyone around them.]
Such fun! Food ok. Not great, not bad. But, place is a joy, corney and entertaining. Great value for the money spent.
Dinner at Bern's was the highlight of our weekend in Tampa. Dinner was superb, atmosphere excellent, service impeccable. We had dessert in the upstairs dessert room following our tour of the wine cellar and kitchen. My husband of less than one year said he should have waited to ask me to marry him in the dessert room - the romance level was that high!
Best appetizers i've had ever! Also had a wonderful, big breakfast next morning. Happy workers, and it helps that they are inside the Heathman Lodge, the most beautiful place we've stayed in a long time. Must find an excuse to return soon!
Words do not describe how great this establishment is! Steaks are the specialty of the house, but the chilled seafood platter and sauteed calamari oscar are superior to any oceanside restaurant! The waitstaff is top notch which makes any night a special occassson for the diners. Don't miss the cafe diablo prepared tableside to end your evening.
We have enjoyed many meals at Nicola's and rate it as one of our favourite eateries. ALWAYS a MUST when on vacation at Rotonda(several times during last 4 week stay).
Great atmosphere, excellent food, and friendly waiters! I have never been disappointed here. You've got to try the Artichoke Chicken Pasta! Oh, I'm hungry just thinking about it...
We have been enjoying the cuisine served in this Restaurant for many years and have never had a bad experience yet. The food, which you pick yourself, is stir-fried in front of you at a central station which is a show in itself.
My family and I (4 adults) have been there 3 times and are planning on going again in March 2005. Food is excellent. Martini's are wonderful. An all-around good experience EVERY time we have been there.
We had an amazing dinner at Sushiya! We sat outside on the patio and had the best sushi I have ever had. This is a great restaurant and highly recommend it to all who love great food with a fun atmosphere, ask for chef CHOI !
Extremely beautiful thought I was in Italy. I suggest everybody to visit this place.
It was a really great place to eat, for the family or as a special night out.
This is an Award winning restaurant. The service there is excellent and the waitresses treat you like you are the only ones in there. There specialty are their BBQ Ribs the price for a slab of ribs are $16.95 and it is worth it, you get the dinner, a roll, all you can eat salad bar, and a potato or your choice. They cater for any kind of events. The banquet room is wonderful!! There is a bar in there where you can watch sports events and dining room for the family. Check out their web site at http://tonysrestaurant.tripod.com/index.html and sign their guest book. Come and see them it is worth going!!!!
We have been dining at Razzoo's for 8 years and it is always a pleasant experience. Try the Chicken Tchoupitoulas!
I have taken several friends to BiCi Bistro which is located in downtown Battle Creek. The atmosphere is very comfortable and the food is outstanding. BiCi Bistro does an excellent job with carry-out as well. As a Sales rep, I often take food to several area offices and the food is always ready when I need it and the office staff rave about the taste.
I had a wonderful, romantic dinner by candlelight with my boyfriend. my meal consisted of fresh homade soup and chicken marsala that gave me chills...the chef vito personally assisted us in our dinner choices and everything was above all my expectations!!! i will be back next week !!!
"The Depot" of Vandalia was a real discovery!! My relatives (parents and sisters/their families) all live in the St Louis area. We visit as much as we can, but lately our retail schedules never seem to be at a point where both of us can get time to go. My birthday was Dec. 5th. I talked to my folks and they wanted to get as many of the siblings together as we could and meet for brunch. We'd seen billboards about the Depot on our way to the ST Louis, but had never been there. I looked online for location and a phone number, also found a single review, which was positive!! I'm reinforcing that review!! We wound up with a total head count of eleven people, met at 1:00 Sunday afternoon on the 14th. Good ole Yahoo Maps led us right to the dooreasily. It's literally a converted Railroad Depot. We did actually have a train go by during the early afternoon. We found Christmas ambiance, attentive and likable service people, a very good selection of both breakfast and dinner foodswe couldn't have done better. (Would actually like to try one of their steaks sometime) Young Michael Mabry took us under his wing, kept the coffee flowing, and served us. (One of life's little "small world" thingsMike had worked in Webster Groveswhich neighbors our Kirkwood home). This young man would've fit in the crowddon't think I've got any unmarried sisters left, though--waaaait a minutethere's a niece or two... One other noteafter admittedly only an hour drive, that Starbuck's coffee was wonderful! We all had a great time, have to give the Depot and it's people an 11 out of a possible 10. They tolerated us being a little later with our celebration than we should've. We'll definitely go back
I'd heard good things about Casey Jones since moving to La Plata, and the experience was everything I'd heard. Good food, exceptional service, quiet and intimate. I'll definitely be a frequent patron.
We've now eaten at the Homestead maybe five times. It is totally surprising to find a restaurant of this quality in Huntsville. You would expect something this fine in Houston, but Huntsville? Everything we've tried has been fantastic. Do not come if you are in a big rush, but this is the perfect way to spend a relaxing evening of dining. They will never try to rush you or hurry you along. It's a great place to eat, drink, and talk with friends.
This restaurant has spectacular food. I ordered Thai Chicken Pasta and it was very good. I will be returning to this restaurant and I strongly recommend it to anyone
We like the elegant, understated decor. The service is more efficient and friendly than any Asian restaurant we'd been to. The food is excellent! We've been there about half a dozen times, and like to try different things because everything is done so well, with the best of ingredients. I love their phad si eiu (sp?) and swimming Rama. This is the best Thai restaurant that I know of in Puget Sound, or anywhere.
The very first time I visited Scoma's Restaurant was while working on a story about "overfishing", for KRON Television In San Francisco. One of the patrons we interviewed for this story was none other than the internationally famous singer, Tony Bennett, I knew then this must be a special place. Sometime later, I called and attempted to make reservations for dinner however, seating at Scoma's is on a first-come, first-served basis. When we arrived there was a large crowd gathered outside and in the lobby, all waiting to be seated, the reason being, Scoma's is rumored to have some of the freshest seafood dishes in town, the best service and the friendliest Dining Room Managers around. If your food is not prepared and served in a timely manner, Dining Room Manager, D'Artagnan will see to it personally that your order arrives. The night we were there, several NFL referees for the upcoming Rams/Forty Niner's game were having dinner. I truly hope they weren't sitting together, but were told the head coach for the Rams Mike Martz was also having dinner at Scoma's around the same time. The wait staff made me feel right at home and our server was always available when we needed something brought to the table. I ordered the aged petite Filet Mignon, there was nothing petite about that steak not to mention, it was cooked to perfection. My only complaint was when I ordered a bottle of Tattinger Champagne at $31.00 per bottle, which I thought wasn't a bad price, the bottle was a split size (20 oz.). I do believe the server should have informed me of the bottle size,(considering that I was hoping to serve a party of 4) so that I would not have been disappointed when it arrived. I would go to Scoma's again, and will the very next time I get a craving for fresh seafood!
My husband and I went out one evening to relaxed and spend our time together without our kids. We didn't know where to go since a lot of restaurants have very poor service and food, or the prices are too high. But we saw Red Robin and we decided to try it there since we heard some friends talking about it a few weeks earlier. As soon as we got close to the doors two smiling hostesses opened the door for us and made us feel at home. The hostess showed us to our table and a few seconds later our waiter greeted us with the warmest welcome and took our drink and food order. He shared his opinion on what he thought was the best meal and he also made us laugh. We never had to ask him to refill our drinks and he totally made us feel relaxed. We will be going back to that restaurant.
My other half took me to San Francisco for Valentines and a friend recommended we try Lupa Trattoria. When we walked in, we were greeted by a very friendly Italian accented waiter who took us to our table. Service was excellent. And we really enjoyed our food. I had the risotto special and then the tiramisu.
Michelina's is a very small independent Italian/pizza restaurant located in the Orange/Derby Shopping Center.Their pizza is excellent,real pizza,not that stuff that those big chains call pizza!The greatest thing is that they have an all-you-can eat pizza bar for only $4.99 per person.They always have 3 different kinds of pizza on it,such as pepperoni,sausage,mushroom,meatball,bacon,cheese,and even gourmet white pizza makes an appearance regularly!The crust is real,not the soggy cardboard found at many pizzerias!Unfortunately,not many people take advantage of this excellent dining experience.Give it a try!
The food was incredible, start to finish. The service was great, everyone was so friendly and helpful. The linguine with clam sauce was very tasty, and the beef carpaccio was worth the trip in itself. Molto bouno :)
These guys have the best customer service there is. Be prepared for friendly conversation and a true Cajun experience. Not to mention, they have the best peanut butter pie in the country. Thanks for such a great experience!
Enjoyed the romantic atmosphere.
Livinstones Restaurant is the place to be!...If you enjoy good food at a reasonable price then this is it. The portions are enormous, and the serivce by Jack was absolutely phenomenal! Not to mention he's real HOT! My girlfriends and I went there for an after work dinner and we all got to feast on a couple of fisherman platters for 2
Nice good food, very fast
I am surprised that no one has mentioned this little place. They serve the best Cheeseburgers and French Fries I have ever had. It is so relaxing in there. This is by far the best burger restaurant in Cincinnati.
Great prices, excellent food and a friendly atmosphere. Not a place you want to pass up.
I really enjoy the experience and will for sure go back!
Rock Bottom Brewery is a great place to eat with a large group or with just a few people. It is a fun place to socialize, while eating great food and having a variety of freshly brewed beers to choose from. I definitely recommend that you choose an appetizer. The Titan Toothpicks are one of the best appetizers that I have ever had and they were a big hit at our table. The portions that they give you are very generous, and you definitely get your moneys worth. I got to take home a doggy bag which made me happy because I got to enjoy my meal one more day. I tried some of the chipotle chicken pizza, which was delicious and the honey chicken sandwich was very fresh and tender. he waitress kept good tabs on our drinks and filled them without being told when they were emptied. This was a great eating experience and I definitely recommend you try it.
Outstanding - probably the best Italian restaurant I've ever been to. Reasonable prices - excellent food and wide variety or northern Italian cooking. Calamari is best you'll ever have as an appetizer. Veal Piallard (pounded veal) delicious. Duck fillets a great meal too. Banana in Fillo dessert is an award winner. Great wine selection. Servers make you feel very welcomed and appreciated. Dinner for two was $120 and worth every penny. Don't wait for this one.
This place is so amazing that I continue to suggest it to anyone I meet that lives from the Bay area to Monterey. If you are ever in the Silicon Valley and looking for a wonderful and different meal, La Fondu is it! We were there for our first wedding anniversary and they brought us a free bottle of wine in celebration. The place is pricey, but perfect for a celebration type dinner or special evening out. It would also be a great place to go as a group of 6 or 8. The atmosphere is very unique and fun.
I was skeptical of the quality of an all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant, but after my initial visit on 1-14-03 I was convinced that Todai Tampa can compete with the best of them. I returned on 1-15-03 and 1-16-03 and the quality of the sushi and the service were still top-notch. I really can't say how good the hot food was as I am a sushi-eater, but I do know my sushi and I can say that Todai Tampa has sushi that is of excellent quality. I kept count on my 2nd and 3rd visits and I had 35 and 37 pieces respectively. Not bad for $22.95. I tried everything at the sushi bar and found all of the food to be of high quality. The service is fantastic too. If I lived in Tampa I'd probably eat there every night, it's that good. No waiting, great service, and excellent sushi---- what more could you ask for?
Beautiful, wonderful, exquisite restaurant. No one should deprive themselves of Kalachandji's in this or any other lifetime.
A great place to eat for those with an Italian craving. All the food is of great proportion and the meals are always hot.
After years of slow service, this chain is under new ownership, and the service is dramatically faster.
I've been to Thurman's 4-5 times now with varying size groups from 5-10 people. Their tables will seat only 6, but they will give you tables that are next to eachother. During the winter with a large party on a Friday night the wait can be a while, but it's WELL worth the wait, and if you go a little early on a Friday night you won't wait at all! Wonderful food, in HUGE portions, and cheap. As a group we usually got burgers and split an order of their fried pretzle bites with honey mustard dipping sause. It cost roughly $11 a person. Everything everyone's tried they've liked. And the staff is extremely friendly. If you want some fun, lots of food at a good price... Try it out!
I know Dwight and Kim and think that they both work very hard to put out excellence service and food, I would glady go back to eat as I do each week. Hats off to and much needed place to each with such and excellence rating. Good Luck.
Narayan's is situated on East Bijou St. in downtown Colorado Springs, a short walking distance from the Adams Mark Antlers Hotel, Tabor Center, and the Pike Peak Center (home > of the Colorado Springs Symphony). To visit Narayan's is far more than just "dining out." Inside, one is practically transported to the foot of the Himalayas...aromas of another world, enchanting Nepalese / Himalayan music, eastern artwork & photos of the Himalayas covering the walls... these are all a part of the dining experience. ...and then the food arrives. We tried several dishes, including curry specialties, nan bread, and lentil soup. These are only a small part of the menu selections. Selections include lamb, noodles, poultry, and a vegetarian list that fills nearly a whole side of a page. The food was superb. The curry was authentic and not the > normal "yellow variety." The lentil soup is the best I have ever tasted. They also serve heated milk tea, the beverage of that region. I must conclude by saying that this restaurant cannot be missed! It is an incredible dining & cultural experience.
The best lasagna ever!
It's a great place to go to before a show or also a great place to take someone from out of town. It has an awesome view of the city and the food is excellent. It is not a casual place to go for dinner. A little pricey, but worth it.
The atmosphere is intimate and inviting; the wait staff is knowledgeable, professional, polished, and attentive; food portion size is respectable, and the food is always excellent in both taste and presentation. The bar area is also intimate, and there is often a small jazz group or pianist entertaining. Overall, an extremely pleasant experience. We drive 120 miles (round trip) to get there, and it is definitely worth the drive.
One of the most impressive and pleasat dinning we have ever experienced. Have reffered friends to visit you and have also been impressed. We are from Florida and every year make it a point to come in and dine when we stay in Gatlinburg. Keep up the great work! The Fernandez Fa.
staff was wonderful, Food was even better. Excellent place to CHOW down. We arrived when the place had just started to get crowded, still had a table and food quickly. Waiting on another trip to Michigan so I can go again.
Excellent Chicago style food which is hard to find in this area. I would highly suggest the sausage/beef combo which will make you stuffed if your able to eat this good sandwich. Parking can sometimes be tough but it's well worth the walk.
Fountain Hills has a real treasure at Redendo's TRY THE PASTA SPECIALS !!!
We have become regulars at Lupa Trattoria. We often just walk in and get a table right away. The service is very friendly and the food is wonderful. I like to start out with the grilled radicchio and goat cheese appetizer then the risotto special or a hand made pasta (ravioli di zucca is as good as in Italy). They have a seasonal menu posted on their website: http://lupatrattoria.com/menu.html
I was amazed by the food and then later informed that the chef trained at the Cordon Bleu of Paris, France. Service was right on time with only a short delay in receiving our check. Overall I loved the experience and can't wait for Valentines Day when we are going for our Second Time.
This is a nice little quaint restaurant that is a must for you to visit! The atmosphere is great, and it's a nice place to go whether you are craving Italian food, salad or a sandwich. Their pizza is awesome. If ever in Va., you ought to give it a try
Very pleasant, quiet atmosphere. Some of the food was very good, and some was average. The ribs were meaty and tender and the sauce was better than average. The deserts were just okay. I always visit The Front Porch when traveling to Hattiesburg.
I was please with all aspects of the dining experience. The food was exceptional as was the service. Considering we had a party of eight one could not ask for more. I would definitely go back on a regular basis.
A warm and friendly experience. Nice people asking if you needed anything at all, not annoying you while you are dining. I recommend Cactus Willie's to everyone that likes different choices.
GREAT seafood and wine list! The restaurant is located within a wine shop and gourmet kitchen shop. All food can be prepared "naked"--- just grilled with olive oil and lime juice. All items have a Latin flair and only the freshest produce and fish are used. The piping hot bread is served with chimichurrie-- a tasty spread made of cilantro,paesley, olive oil, and garlic. Don't visit HHI without trying this spot!
We love Dusit Thai! It's a great place to take guests from out of town, very nice for dining there or ordering take-out (free delivery is a bonus). The rock shrimp appetizer is delicious. In fact, we've always been delighted with whatever we've ordered, everything on the menu is terrific. Highly recommended.
This place felt like home! The owners,two brothers, Brendan & Sean Straw treat everyone like family and really go out there way to show you a good time. The huge bar which is usually crowded is the best place to catch a game because of the 14 TV's to choose from. When your there, try one of there draft beers ,they have 12 to choose from, I recommend the Broadway Station Ale its got a great flavor. The buffalo wings were the best I've ever tasted. The burger was excellent ,the meat was so fresh and cooked perfect. This place is a great find and great hangout ,hope to see you there!
This is my all-time favorite place in all of NYC. I found it by accident and keep coming back because of the wonderful food and extremely attentive wait staff. I am originally from the West Coast and have many people visit me here each year. So far all 10 people that have been out here since last spring have been taken to Andavi and have had nothing but wonderful things to say about it.
Imelda's is a small family run place, neat as a pin. You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table. Imelda is there every day to cook the meals and greet the guests. The staff is friendly. The prices are better than reasonable. A great value for the money. The food is great. The best thing on the menu are the breakfast tacos, which you can get any time of day and have made to your preferences. .
(Montgomery @ Juan Tabo Location) We were quickly greeted and seated in the 2 story "courtyard" complete with fountain, surrounding bar, and banquet room. Our server was prompt to ask for our order and not in the annoying way that so many of us know of that visit this type of restaurant. The chips and dip arrived soon after and the sauce is certainly the highlight of the pre dinner (and if you're ever in the Albuquerque area, find a Furrs, Raley's, or Albertson's store and pick up a jar or two). The food arrived soon after (Shredded Beef Enchiladas & A small Fajita platter). Those expecting traditonal "wrap" enchiladas will find the "shelf" variation.Not bad, but I am used to the wrap. Others seeking Fajitas will not be disappointed as everything is seasoned to perfection and you get an ample supply of tortillas. Rice is seasoned with a tomato paste/cilantro mix which is quite pleasing while the beans
The gentleman who waited on us was exceptional! He was very attentive, yet not overbearing. We commented on the fact that he knew when to be available, and when to be discreet. The atmosphere is absolutely stunning, while the food is delicious. I have not had such fine dining since I had eaten at Top of the Hub in Boston. There was lovely piano playing to accompany the ambiance of the restaurant. As the theme is "The Rat Pack", it is filled with classic and tasteful memorabilia. Overall we had a wonderful night, and plan to return shortly. The menu is 5 star, and I am eager to sample other items.
I don't know what the other reviewer was talking about. This restaurant is one of my favorite mexican restaurants in the world. The wait staff is friendly, the food is great, they give you gigantic beers to drink. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone and everyone who likes mexican food.
Very friendly wait staff. very good food. Excellent atmosphere. Excellent view of Mississippi River.
REVIEW DELETED DUE TO POSTING POLICY VIOLATIONS
The service at this restaurant was out of this world. And with kids you need that. The food came quick and hot. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone on vacation in Florida.
Max and DeDe are terrific hosts and we always enjoy our experience at the Shields Manor Bistro. From the shrimp appetizer to the home-made pies everything is fantastic. Some of our personal favorites are Lobster Tail and Osso Bucco. We have been dining there for over two years and love to bring our out of town guests, everyone raves about the food and the atmosphere. We look forward to our next visit.
When you enter the restaurant area you see a beautiful hand painted mural. Its amazing. Must see for yourself. The atmosphere is warm and friendly. The waiters made me feel like I was the queen of the empire. We had French Honey Cognac Sea Scallops and Rare Sashami Tuna. All special are prepared by Master Chef Vito (quite handsome I must say). We had a wonderful evening. Chef Vito has many selections on his menu. I will be returning to try them all.
Our family had a wonderful time. Great service. Alot of fun. The children had a blast.
When you walk into Shields Manor Bistro, a restored 1840's house, you feeling like you are stepping back in time. To an era when guests were greeted, made to feel welcome, and served on the very best china! In this fast paced world we live in today, this relaxed atmosphere replenishes our soul and revives our spirits, making our time spent there one to cherish, leaving a desire to return, again and again. The front foyer opens into the Parlor where you can dine in front of the fireplace, or gaze out the window at the newly restored area of Main Street while enjoying lunch, dinner or a refreshing drink of your choice. Or choose the relaxed setting of the Den with its more masculine feel. Max and DeDe make you feel like you are a guest in their home. Their signature Courthouse Cuisine changes each day. Soup, sandwiches, salads, along with Max's special Hot and Spice Chili are on the luncheon menu. Add a desert to end the perfect meal. Come often and stay to visit with friends. This 150-year-old house has become a meet and greet place for lunch 11 a.m. to 2.p.m or perhaps late afternoon tea at 3 p.m. Tuesday through Sundays. Breakfast is served Saturday mornings only from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. or they will cater breakfast, lunch or dinner for you group. Old-fashioned Sunday dinner at the 1850's circa home is from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Candle light dinners Friday and Saturday evenings from 5:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. Champagne, wines, beers and port along with that famous Platte County Black Bottom Pie, Mom's Apple Pie, or a variety of different Cheesecakes are offered. Platte city is just 3 miles north of the Kansas city International airport!
Wonderful - Great Value. Had a "15 ounce Charcoal Ribeye" which was cooked perfect. Beer was cold and server was cute! Piano playing in background was a bit mello but it grew on us.
There are so many good things to say about Riccardos, I don't even know where to begin. Let me start by saying, the food is EXCELLENT!!! It is by far, one of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. The food is always fresh and delicious. Hats off to the chef. I eat there twice a week, and would not think about eating Italian food anywhere else in the area. Not to mention that the prices are unbelievably cheap for the amount of food you get. All the entrees come with soup, salad and garlic knots. And the large menu has lots to choose from. The service at Riccardos is outstanding. Sergio, my waiter, is the best I have ever had in my 29 years. He is very courteous, friendly and attentive. He always recommends the best dishes and makes a 'killer' cappuccino. He will make sure you have the BEST dining experience possible. As I always do. The atmosphere of the restaurant is one that is pleasant and cozy. They have a beautiful hand painted Italian mural on the wall, and all the tables are all candlelit. It makes you feel right at home. But me raving about this restaurant is not going to do it justice. You MUST experience it for yourself....you won't be sorry.
Outstanding !! After three days of mediocre to poor meals, it was with apprehension that we took another recommendation from a new concierge. However, this time he was right on the money. From the wonderfully sweet and attentive waitress, to the melt in your mouth veal, delicious, not overpowering sauces, the meal was excellent. We would all go there regularly if Capri was a local neighborhood restaurant back home. Absolutely, give this restaurant your business
AAAA++++ Excellent!
Very good food, especially for beef eaters. The regional favorite "Beef on Weck" sandwich is excellent.
My girlfriend and I wanted to spend a special and romantic night together and we started off at dinner. We both wanted to eat at an Italian restaurant and heard that a special little restaurant called Riccardos Italian eatery was in the area so we decided on eating there. Our waiter was perfect in every aspect and the food was the best I have ever experienced. The chef/owner was nice enough to meet and greet us so we could let him know how great his food and service was. He was a perfect gentleman and from his manner of speaking and presentation was an excellent buisnessman. We definatly had a romantic and very very special night. I will most undoubtedly come back for another great expericence in Italian Eatery. I give it a ten outta 10!
This is a charming Texas restaurant with a Western theme. Very friendly staff, quick service and good food. The decor is rustic and includes a full size stuffed buffalo. The atmosphere is clean and the ambience is country. If you like country, this is a must visit when in Houston. Live entertainment in the evenings.
A great dining experiance. Wonderful menu, everything was top notch. We will return many times.
The Best!!! I haven't had Risotto this good since Milan in 1998.. Bravo to staff and management, they made us feel like family.. Lots of complimentary tastings... Bravo...
This is an amazing restaurant, tucked away in a non-descript neighborhood. The ambiance is funky, the food is amazing (Carribean) and if there is a fish special, order it! My boyfriend and I go there for special occassions and whenever we have guests in town that we want to show a good time. Plus, the Sangria is amazing...
Wonderful food. Great atmosphere and a pleasure....
This quickly became my favorite Italian restaurant in Austin! Excellent food, excellent people, and a very tasteful atmosphere to complement it all puts it right up there on the top of the list. Definitely worth the visit!
We love Indian Delite and have been regulars there for over ten years. The food is always wonderful, fresh and seasoned to your request. I (Pete) am a vegetarian and their vegetarian selections always satisfy. Mandy eats meat, she has tried most of the dishes and has yet to find one that she did not describe as "Excellent!" And the big surprise considering they have the best food around, the prices at Indian Delite are a real value, generally much lower than other Indian restaurants in the area. The owners are friendly and when they are available, they make it a practice to visit each table to make sure you are satisfied. We consider the food and value of Indian Delite to be such a cut above the rest that we regularly drive the 45 minutes from our home to eat there, passing other restaurants on the way. Highly Recommended. .
I recently found Sushi Dake in Burbank, and I'm definitely glad I did. What a great restaurant! There's ample parking available, fresh delicious food, and great service. Not only is there a sushi bar headed by a charming sushi chef, but the menu also features tempura, salads, appetizers, udon, and teriyaki. The people are friendly and courteous, and the ambiance is quaint, inviting, and exceptionally clean (a MUST for a sushi restaurant). I highly recommend Sushi Dake to everyone!!
First, a really cute waiter gave us (5 scruffy kids in stained jeans) complimentary wine while we waited outside, and we thankfully drank them out of little paper cups. As our waiter returns back inside, two older Guys half joking ask, "Hey, can we have some?" and the waiter deadpans back, "Hmm,... no." Yes, this is a place that's young, punky, kind, serves amazing food, the staff looks happy and overall, is the most comfortable restaurant I've been in, in years. I had to write a rebuttal to the review above about "the only vegan thing" being a pizza without the cheese... you lost out! You must have missed the notation on the bottom of the menu that said that vegan substitutions are possible and ENCOURAGED; which is too bad because I had the BEST VEGAN PIZZA of my life here, along with a Mushroom Fettucini that was really subtle and wonderful at first, but without the cream sauce that it noted on the menu, I ended up adding some salt to it. On the other hand, we gorged ourselves on the free delicious rosemary bread with olive oil and crushed garlic (it wasn't raw garlic, but it wasn't cooked either- I don't know how they did it, but it was deeelicious) and the Booberry Salad was a masterpiece. The blueberries didn't overhwelm the rest of the dish, and the sugar walnuts made the dish over the top good. Everyone else enjoyed their meal, but I hear that their Halibut could have been better (the mango sauce was reportedly cold and the fish a tad overcooked) and the Tofu dish wasn't as up to snuff as everything else. This is the place where you can get really great food without a snotty attitude. The waiter gave us so many suggestions for EXCELLENT vegan food, and it was thoughtful, rich, complex and fulfilling vegan food that wasn't cliched or rice noodles or tofu. It was just damn good and it made this vegan, quite ecstatic and overcome with praise, as you can see!
This is truly one of the best Italian dining experiences I've ever had. We were told about this restaurant by our hotel concierge, and boy was he right on! The service was impeccable. We were waited on hand and foot from the moment we walked in the door. If you like great Italian food and enjoy an Italian experience reminiscent of a good old New York mafia joint, then this is the place for you! If you're in Tampa, don't miss the chance to dine at Donatello's.
Not so much a restaurant as a sandwich counter. Food is good, but greasy. Another place that's good if your on Bradley's campus.
Went to have dinner. After walking through front door two people were arguing about work enviroment(which scared me right away.) Beautiful place, atmoshere could be fantastic. Food was over priced for what you recieved. Kids working, fooling around for such a classy place. Needs more professionalism.
Dreadful. We dined in the early evening on a weeknight, so we were seated with no problem. However, the food was prepared with little thought; I ordered Kung Pao chicken. Having ordered Kung Pao in many restaurants world wide, I have never been served "sauteed chicken and vegetables"; the indifferent waitress insisted that this dish was Kung Pao. Small portions, no flavor, dismal wait staff. There are many other restaurants in Chinatown worthy of your time.
We arrived at about 7:45 PM, on a Wednesday evening. There was a couple leaving, so we had the restaurant to ourselves. Our first "uh-oh" was when we ordered a bottle of cabernet and were informed, after he searched, that there was two glasses of the wine we wanted, but no full bottle. I said my date could have the wine and I would drink Sing-ha beer. They had no beer. He explained that their delivery did not come on schedule. We had wine from several opened bottles and it was OK. For appetizers we had fresh spring rolls and Thai coconut milk soup with chicken ("Tom kha gai"). Both were excellent and fresh. The soup was very rich and intense-probably pure coconut milk and lime juice! My entree was Pla rad prik or deep-fried snapper with chili sauce. This was unconventional in that the fish was not scored and overcooked to the point that some of it was chewy. Also that it came with finely chopped red and green bell peppers and a nice brown sauce, but no chili sauce or "heat" to be found! A nice treatment was fried basil and a sculpted disc of carrot that adorned the fish. I didn't mention NOT FRESH, did I? It was edible but not what I expected. My date's main dish was Thai Chicken with Basil or "Gai Pad Gaprao". This was a nice dish but too sweet and overpowered with fish sauce for my taste. We were offerred free tapioca pudding, which we declined, because we were freezing our tails off! Our feet were quite cold, even though we were on a slightly elevated area! All in all, a fairly dissapointing experience. I really should have sent the fish back.... Our bill was $57 plus change before tip. About right, since my fish was a fancy dish. I can see how they might be a good restaurant on another night. I am willing to try them again.
Raffery's is kind of like an Applebee's without the huge crowds. Decent food, above average prices. The best they have to offer as far as entres go is their black and blue strip. If you like blue cheese this is the dish for you. Also the apitizer to get is their cheese fries. Wonderful skin on fries with cheese, bacon bits, and a killer dipping sauce. Its so big, it could be a 1 person meal in itself.
Better choice to eat will be 'famous daves' instead (in brookfield) serving almost exactly same kind of food. This place is overrated.
Basic food---No frills--- Don't expect much. Entrees lack seasoning and creativity.
Food was average, prices were average, seats were very very cramped. Overall it was fine, nothing special.
The service at Von's was terrible. The waitress was rude from the beginning and never returned to see if we needed anything else. When I asked for our receipts, she said "would you like me to stop so that I can have this conversation with you" and "I have to serve these people first before I can get your recepts." We had already been waiting a half and hour. The manager who did not help the situation at all, did nothing and I suspect that both of them talked bad about us while we were sitting and watching them.
The nice thing is that you can have them make just what you want. Oh boy, now I can get anchovies with no complaints, right? WRONG! The pizza makers made jokes about it that I could hear and the waitress delivered it holding her nose! Guess I'll have to make my own when my wife and daughter are gone.
Business lunch. Restaurant opened beg. of week. Minimalist decor & portions; definitely a low/no carb place. No dessert available; no salt & peppers on tables. Great gourmet/nouveau cuisine style food and great service. If they want to serve the local business lunch crowd, they'd better wake up and be more generous with the portions, at least.
After dining here a few times I ordered food to go. When I got home, I discovered that the portions were extremely small (not even enough for one person). For example, one of the 6 enters was a stir-fried chicken with broccoli, for $7.95. It had 6 pieces of broccoli and 4 pieces of chicken. Since I had eaten there before and not had this problem I thought there had been a mistake. So I called the owner, he was very apologetic on the phone and asked me to come back over and he would fix the situation. I thought this was a nice gesture, however, when I arrived a man who I believe was the cook brought out a serving of one of the entrees that I had ordered threw it on the table and said, "Do you think this is enough for you". From there he was extremely rude, and accused me of just wanting a free meal (my bill was $59, definitely not free). The owner said nothing the entire time, except " we have been here for 6 months and nothing has ever been said before". I never did figure out why the owner asked me to come back. Suffice it to say I wouldn't recommend going there to anyone, and if you do, beware of the cook in the back.
At this writing it's Jan 31 2003 and we understand that the corporate owners of EQUESTRIA sold the restaurant out....probably because it was a bow-wow just like the first reviewer was describing...and the odd behavior of the chef...frankly this place is mediocre to bad...and very inconsistent....I would not bother with this one.
It wasn't spectacular, food was okay - probably wouldn't eat there again but my friend likes to go there.
The food was beautifully presented but mediocre tasting. We were ripped off on bottled water at $9/. Only 3 people ordered bubbly water. At the end of the meal while we were having coffee they opened the 4th bottle and topped off all the glasses. Never a word asking if we wanted more! They took advantage of the group dynamics. This is unconscionable behavior.
This is a restaurant that you visit for the experience of eating at Joe's. Yes the wait is long and the service rushed, but that is part of the fun of trying one of Miami's most famous eateries. If you do go, don't waste your money on the other fish dishes, only get the fresh Stone Crabs and finish off your meal with the delicious key lime pie.
The food was very good, but the service was terrible on several occasions.
Staff was friendly; dining room was almost empty (10-12 other people dining);waitress was not aware that they were out of one of the entrees and one of the red wines ordered and we had to re-order; food was excellent; wine by the glass is a bit expensive; wait staff seemed short-handed; wonderful atmosphere; great decor. Will return because the food was excellent.
Eh...Khory's serves a combination of Meditteranean Food and American Sandwiches. Being the American Sandwich guy I am, that's what I got. Wasn't totally impressed. They didn't really do anything I couldn't do. However, the portions were big and the service was fast, so it is recommendable for something a little different in this part of town.
Frank would NOT approve! Made reservations for 6:45 on a Saturday night so we could begin our meal when the live piano music started at 7:00. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant at 6:35 (we were early). Background music (Sammy Davis), was so quiet, you couldn't hear it. What little art they displayed was set so far away from my table, I couldn't see any of it. For all I knew, sitting there with no music, I could have been anywhere. So much for atmosphere. Our dinner was ready much too quickly and was horrible. For the prices, I would expect a lot more. It's not a good sign when half of the lamb chop is unchewable gristle and fat. Not that I could see what I was eating since it was so dark. Piano player was late, and mediocre at best. I can cook better food myself, and should have stayed home listening to their "Live at the Sands" album for better food and atmosphere. Overpriced, Overrated, and definately not worthy of the Rat Pack name. Avoid at all costs.
Funky decorated bistro that is broken up with walls and booths to create an intimate atmosphere. Service is very slow and unattentive. The flavors of the sauces and dressings are quite good. The only problem is the quality of the entrees. Both of our dishes (fish and chicken) were not of high quality. For the prices charged the quality shoulf be a higher grade.
I've never walked out of a dinner buffet before, but I was close with this one. There just wasn't much that I found very good. I have talked to others who raved about the place, so maybe it's just me.
We were seated promptly, however, our waitress did not appear to greet us for at least 5 minutes. She was busy, understaffed I guess? Although she was very friendly, our food came out wrong. I think there was a language barrier. Other people in my party ordered Coronas and didn't recieve them until the meal arrived. The salsa was great but the quaso was little to be desired. Food came out hot but was somewhat bland. I had fajitas, others had enchilladas and combos. Overall I was not impressed. Could get the same quality at Taco Bell for half the price. Will not be back.
The Grand Buffet is a buffet style restaurant offering a wide variety of foods including American and Italian with a strong Chinese presence. We have dined here 3 times in the last year or so. On both of the previous occasions we were impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.On this visit many of the buffet items,while not in any way disgusting,lacked proper flavoring due to a lack of sufficient seasonings. Also,the roast beef was quite tough! We will visit them again at some future date to see if this was just a glitch or if their food has permanently deteriorated.
On Sunday's the hotel offers a brunch they offer a wide variety of seafood,desserts, fresh omelets and a carving station. the food is rather good. My beef is with the service we were treated to the brunch by a very dear friend so the bill was taken care of when we arrived. When our server noticed the receipt his attitude seemed to have changed... It almost took an act of congress to get our plates removed or get a refill on our orange juice and Champagne, we were almost totally ignored by the waitstaff It seem like since our bill was already paid for he assumed there would be no tip... I was very disappointed with the service but loved the food.,
I am a Miami native and this was my first visit to Joe's. If I want stone crabs, I usually go to the local grocery store or fish market. But, a co-worker wanted to try this place so we all went. Joe's Stone Crab is, in a word, OVERRATED! It is a ripoff. To top it all off, the wait staff was the snobbiest bunch ever -- and rude! I wanted to scream, "LOOK, YOU ARE HERE TO SERVE US SO KILL THE FREAKING ATTITUDE!" We arrived at 11:30 and avoided the "crowd." Thank goodness for that because I could not imagine waiting 3 hours for the Joe's "dining experience." Whomever believes that Joe's serves the best seafood either does not know good seafood or they are out of their freaking mind. I will never pay to eat at Joe's again!
My thanks to Infusinos and owner Frank Buratti for ruining an otherwise fine evening. After waiting an hour for my food, my pizza was delivered burnt and cold. Frank refused me a refund and forced me to come pick up the replacement pizza. This establishment cares far more about money than customers and proves it in their words and actions.
Eating at this restaurant is like joining ants descending on a carcass. It's like no one there has eaten in a week, it is the most disgusting display of gluttony and so crowded and loud playing bizarre pop music. People eat here with such poor manners that food flew through the air and got caught in my hair more than once from people NOT at my table. It's too crowded. The hot food, while ample, tasted old. The sushi did not taste fresh, which is a scary thing regarding sushi. The lines for food were impossibly long. They refilled drinks readily and cleared plates often and that was really the only redeeming thing I have to say about the restaurant. And the location? Sucks. You have to deal with all the movie traffic and the freeway offramp. It's always cold in Daly City and their lobby cannot accomodate the line, which runs out the door; so bring a jacket with your barf bag.
Would never go again. food and service were very disappointing.
My wife and I made a reservation for an anniversary dinner at Olive's Bistro in Stowe for this past Tuesday, October 21. We drove 30 miles from our home to get to the restaurant and were quite surprised to discover that it was closed. It wasn't a one-time Tuesday closing, either: A sign out front said that the season schedule was from Wednesday through Sunday. It seems unlikely to me that the young woman who took the reservation Friday night didn't know that the establishment was going to be closed the following Tuesday. I called to complain on Wednesday. The woman with whom I spoke said, "Well, there's nothing we can do about it now," and offered not one word of apology. The owner was not in the establishment at the time, but I left my number in case he wanted to call me the next day. He never did. I can think of plenty of things the restaurant could do to make amends, but either none of these options have occurred to them, or they simply don't care. So I respectfully request that all of you avoid Olive's Bistro. Thank you.
Charlotte Restaurant is described by its management as "the quintessential brunch locale to visitors to Times Square." What they neglect to inform people, either on the web or on the telephone, is that brunch is not served until September. Strike one. When asked, they would not make an omelette. Strike two. Nevertheless, we stayed and had lunch. Strike three. Overpriced and bland is being kind in describing their lunch menu, while the wait staff was inattentive. One understands why patrons were so sparce. In conclusion, I won't go there again and won't recommend it to others.
While seated at the bar having dinner, I was suddenly drenched with water from the ceiling. The water got into my dinner and ruined my shirt. The female manager came over and told me to "talk to my roofer about it". There was no apology or any offer to reconcile the matter. We paid our bill and left. When we telephoned later to complain about the situation, the owner would not take our call. They certainly do not know how to run a business. They left us with the impression that they have enough business and obviously do not need ours. The management was abusive and uncaring. This occurred during the summer of 2003.
We are both long-time patrons of Atomic. The food is always awesome and the atmosphere usually great too. BUT.....we are VERY disappointed with Dale's decision that there is no smoking permitted at the upper level OUTDOOR bar/dining area. We went there this week to enjoy the patio dining experience. We were told smoking could only take place over on the lower bar patio (which was roped off/close) and no service available. Why management chooses to run off all it's smoking customers by such a ridiculous rule (it's OUTSIDE for gawd's sake!) is beyond us. Inside we understand, but outside makes no sense. Get with it Dale, before winter gets here!!
A great little Irish Pub near campus. Pretty good food at decent prices. As with a few other bars in Champaign, I was disappointed in the self service. They had a seperate counter to order your food then go pick it up. It may be convienent if your just there to eat, but as far as making a night out of it, it was a little wierd to me.
Quite possible the worst burgers I've ever eaten. Just not very good and pretty thin. Go next door to a fast food joint.
Great view of Lake Champlain and Fort Ticonderoga, looking at Vermont shoreline. Accessible by car or snowmobile. Local, fun food-- homemade comfort food. Do not miss the soup!
good service good environment but too expensive and food isn't that good
Couldn't agree more that this is the best Chinese food in Connecticut. You definitely get your money's worth, unlimited Sushi, Peking Duck, Crab Legs, Lobster Dishes.... I generally dislike the buffet experience, but I'll make an exception for this place.
My husband took me there to celebrate my birthday. The waitress was very pregnant and had at least 5 tables to serve. She took our order, never came back to see if we needed anything. We had to ask the owner who walked by for coffee. Our plates sat in front of us way too long after we were done. My daughters cream brulee was burnt. We left a 13% tip because we were not pleased with our service. Dinner for 5 came to approx. 300.00. When the waitress took our check she shared with the other waiters what we left and as we walked out another waiter coughed and said cheep (trying to disguise his comment). He not only did it once but twice to be sure I heard it. I confronted him and he denied having said it. My husband was in the restroom when I met him outside and told him we both went in to confront the owner. The owner called the waiter asked if he said it and of course he denied it. I know what I heard. It is not a cheap restaurant and I expected better service. I also expected the owner to repremand the waiter, but he didn't and he allowed the waiter to insinuate that I was not telling the truth. There are too many restaurants in Naples to have to tolerate that kind of treatment. My husband and I dine out quite often and don't mind paying for excellent service. We were not happy and will never return!
Not a bad little place for a quick meal in the tiny town of Cubs, but it's nothing that you can't get anywhere else. Standard cafe menu with a specialiy of ice cream. If you need to eat while passing through, this is the place to do it, but nothing worth going out of your way for.
Service was overly slow. Addtionally, we were there for lunch, ordered from the lunch menu, served lunch sized portion, and were charged for dinner. To say the least we were significantly over charged, and the food was bland.
I am a vegan and there was nothing on the menu for me but pizza, hold the cheese. Nice atmosphere though.
Heavy, uninspired food, eaten under a pall of cigarette smoke. Very slow service, though not unfriendly. There are many better restaurants in Ashland. Not recommended.
My visit to this new Yaletown restaurant was welcomed with open arms when my date asked me to go out on Sat night. I work in an office building just down the block from the restaurant. Many of my associates have had good dining experiences at Glowbal but to be honest, I have heard a few bad things about them too. I decided to try the so called new, trendy and hip Vancouver hot spot for the first time on a busy Sat night. Mabye the weekend is not the right time to go to Glowbal as our experience was soured by a very stressed out staff and a less than impressive dinning experience. Our hostess welcomed us upon arrival with a smile and was pleasant. Our server was a whole different story. I did feel a bit for her as she was very busy that night. I have a few friends that work in the hospitality industry so I have been educated on the stresses of a busy night. My date was wanting a glass of wine but by the time our server got around to asking us for our beverage order, the thought of waiting for another 15 minutes for our cocktails turned us off. We tried a few satays and were dissapointed with our selections. The skewers were a bit on the tough side but the flavours were interesting. A bit too small for us so we tried a salad and the scallop appetizer. Both dishes were small and unappealing. We decided that ordering entrees would be a waste of our money and obviously the kitchen was not staffed to handle the busy night. We asked for our bill and the server did not even ask us why we were leaving so soon. (about 50 minutes) We were not happy with our night out so we ventured down the street to Cioppinos. The night ended on a pleasant note but would have been great if we had never ventured to Glowbal. Too bad....for such high expectaions, we left with a bitter memory of this so called trendy Vancouver hot spot.
my wife & i arrived first , my wife told the waitress to put hers on her own ck. we then ordered our drinks then ordered our appetitizer. my daughter& son in law then came in ,they were taking me out for my birthday my daughter & i ordered the ribs, boy was that a mistake!!!! my wife ordered chicken monterey my son in law ordered crab legs another mistake. my wife told the waitress no honey mustard on the chicken she brings her chicken to her with honey mustard on it & asks if she wants it , my wife said no. the ribs were so dry & tasteless you could pick 1 strand of meat at a time & also tough. my son in laws crab legs were cold & couldn't even get all the meat out w/o splitting the shells in two. we then got our checks & guess what both checks had a gratuity of 15% added to them, almost $3.00 just for my wife & $10.00 for 3 people. my son in law paid the bill the waitress won;t bring back the change we had to get the manager to get her to bring back their change, oh yeah my daughter never got a refill of tea . i will never go back oh yeah the mgr never said anything.
The menu was limited and what was on the menu was priced so that the buffet was more appealing. The layout of the buffet was nice, but the food was mediocre at best. Some of the food was not hot enough and some food had been under the heat for so long that it had started to show signs of drying on the buffet tables. There was a large variety of foods to choose from, however the taste of the food was not worth paying $20/person for. I tried some of the seafood items on the layout, but only ate a portion of each type of fish because there were too many bones in it or the fish tasted bad. I tried a seafood dish which was a fish covered in a southwest sauce, but I could only take a bit of it. I then food such as their lasagne but was very disappointed as it tasted worse than school cafeteria food...bland and lifeless. I would say that if you want to spend $20/person on a good seafood meal, you would be better suited to go to Bonefish Grille. If you just want a decent seafood meal without the high price...you could always go to Libby Hill. I don't see Goosby's staying around for the long haul without some major changes to their business.
Long wait, very loud restaurant. The waiter forgot to announce specials, brought apps with meal, when asked for a drink from the bar he claimed "we don't have that" although we'd seen it. Food: terrible! Very salty cioppino, greasy salmon, although scalloped potato side was very good. The waiter was uninformed about coffee drinks, didn't know what an "au lait" was. Charming tableside opera singer.
I have heard this cafe referred to as "Attitude Centrale" and "PMS Cafe" and boy, were they ever accurate! This is a simple cafe, yet the servers think they are doing you a huge favor by allowing you to pay for their overpriced meals and snotty service.
we had a very rude waitress and the manager wasn't nice either
A part of the HSM Host chain. In the locateion that was once Cheers. Busy area but the staff does it's best to keep the pace going. Food is abovaverage and we were pleased with the black bean soupm and soft shell tacos. For non smokers, the only draw back is that this is one of the few locations in the airport to smoke.
This is a brand new microbrewery in the central Florida area. The restaurant indicates that their cuisine is Belgian as is their microbrewery. Additionally, they advised us that they have been in business for over 250 years. My question is "where" and "how"? We've experienced other microbreweries in our travels. Most have a wide selection of beers and ales. This "establishment" only provided 3 types. The dark beer was absolutely disgusting. The waiter was a young man who was not familiar with the menu and when asked what the Belgian seasoning was on the hamburger, he indicated that it just tasted like a regular hamburger to him and he did not notice a seasoning... I ordered a salmon/pasta dish which came drenched in a creamy pesto sauce. When I say drenched, I mean swimming. The sauce contained no salt whatsoever and certainly was in keeping with the bland cuisine of some of the European countries. My husband ordered a chicken dish which closely would have resembled Chicken Cordon Bleu- however, this was dry as a bone and devoid of seasoning. They featured Belgian Potato Logs- and "logs" they were. These were scoops of baked potato breaded with beer batter and fried- if you dropped them from buildings, you'd kill people. Beverage service for soft drinks was lacking while it was noted that the wait staff were congregating and chatting. The restrooms were disgustingly dirty.
I've been many times and had the same poor service every time! Don't waste your money! Go to Chili's or something else!
Way too crowded. They have lots of food to choose from, but they aren't that good. Also it's a bit overpriced. And please turn that annoying music down. The only plus is their service, they do come to take your plates pretty often.
If you want quantity over quality, then this might be the place for you. The salad bar was not very good at all. Very bland flavored food. I have been to much better Brazilian Restaurants. Staff was very nice and the cost was okay.
My wife and I, along with our friend Marie and her two daughters, visited the China Dynasty last Saturday for their dinner buffet. We were on our way home to Connecticut after spending the day visiting Yankee Candle's main location and the Magic Wings Butterfly conservatory in Deerfield, Massachusetts. We had been looking forward to sampling China Dynasty's offerings for quite a while as they had been voted the "Best All-You-Can-Eat" restaurant in the Pioneer Valley by a reader's poll in the Pioneer Valley Advocate. We were very disappointed by the offerings on their buffet, which were, at best,run-of-the mill. We are not saying that their food was disgusting or anything like that,just that it was in no way worthy of winning any type of an award. We suspect that,since Amherst is a "college town",the ballot box ended up being "stuffed" by the local students. If this restaurant were located anywhere else,it's buffet would most likely have not even gotten a single vote.
This is my husband's favorite restaraunt so we often end up here even if we don't care too much for it. Problem is that he loves the burgers, but then feels guilty and orders a salad - healthier - and is NEVER satisfied with the salad. We went with his mom this time and she - being healthy - order the steak salad and was not at all pleased. We had hoped that the salads would be better than before with all the new promo being done, but they are the same - BORING (iceburg lettuce in clumps, boiled sliced egg, diced tomatoes, shredded cheddar) and the meat was not chewable. My husband got the salad with grilled chicken, but again complained. BORING, no flavor to the chicken. I got the hamburger, ordered it medium well and got it medium rare. On every visit, we always have at least one order messed up, so one of us doesn't get served until everyone else is through eating - so I didn't send it back. His mother and I will be sure to out vote him if he wants to go again, unless he promises to get a burger. None of us will try the salad again.
This is how the restaurant is not worth a referral: * a tourist- made reservations- 2 weeks in advance * call to inform them we are running a few minutes late- unfamiliar with Philadelphia (they inform us it is alright and that they are running behind schedule anyway) * They say we are late- so make us wait- which is fine- but half an hour turned to over an hour * they let people go ahead of us- who had reservations an 1 hour after us * they are very rude epecially the hostess- who ignored us when approached and did not re-write our names down * when speaking to the Manager- he says the wait is not a reflection of their service * no apolgies * for waiting for over an hour- we had to pay of Valet and a coat check! We stood and waited near the doors- there wasn't even a seating area to wait. I am from Toronto, where a well-rated restaurant has a reputation because of their service. My first impression of an Italian restaurant in Philadelphia was overshadowed by such apalling conduct. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Philadelphia especially.on Valentines! They ruined my night and had not even an apology.
Converted country coach house to an Irish pub. Extensive beer on tap menu--- Live music--- a great local hangout. Denoted heart healthy menu, cozy bar. Many individual rooms offer opportunities for private dining experiences.
We went to the restaurant on a friday and weere seated an it took 40 minutes for us to get our appetizer and it was cold when we got it. Then the main dish came out and none of our party was impressed with the food. My wife had a problem with her food and told the waitress and she later told us the chef got mad and there was nothing wrong with her food. We will never go here again!
This is a large restaurnat that serves "americanized" Mexican food. Many platters and combos are available. Waitstaff keep the complementary chips and salsa bowls full.
eh....just another sandwhich shop. Nothing about the place really stands out to me.
This restaurant that has been open for about 6 months is run by owners with no experience in the business and it shows. After a long wait due to a mistake by the owner, we got to sit down. He promised to make up for it by providing us a bottle of wine on the house, but it never showed up. The Romanian waitress (she was very nice but not experienced) showed up and we placed our drink and food order. We waited and waited, and had to remind the waitress about the missing beer, bread and water. The salads showed up very small and pricy. For example $7.50 for a tiny Greek style salad with tasteless tomatoes. It is the first time I have ever seen a salad that is so small is should be served in a coffee cup. At this time, we are laughing and trying to be understanding thinking that they are having employee issues. Next came the food. My son's pasta showed up without chicken (they ran out and offered no replacement). Next some pathetic poorly displayed plates that looked like something out of a cafateria. At $18 a plate, this is no longer funny. The veal special had no taste and all of the pasta was hard from being left under heat lamps. Meanwhile we have learned that one of the waitresses is also the owner and cook. We explained how there were issues with the food and she said she would make adjustments. 1/2 hour later (and not eating this slop) we got a $160 bill with no adjustments. I gave them the VISA card and got the hell out of there before I got poisoned.
Skip this "downtown" experience...who wants to "go downtown" in Memphis at night? The food is simply not worth the hassle and trip if you live past the Perimeter
This seemed like a place that might have been good once but is on it's way out. The lights are way too bright.
I and several friends went to North Conway to visit a collegue of ours who lives there. She and I, along with my 9 month old baby got to the restaurant first and asked if we could be seated. The remainder of our party was delayed by 15 minutes and in the meantime we ordered wine and appetizers for the whole table (6 of us). Right after the wine was opened and the appetizers delivered a woman came to the table and started clearing the seats that were for the rest of our party. Only when we asked what she was doing did she rudely say she was clearing the table because our guests didn't show up and they needed to seat the table (mind you we already had food ordered and sitting on this table). We were told that we could all shove ourselves around a table meant for 3 people. We tried to fit the chairs and the high chair around the small table but it would not work at which time we asked for the bill. If the restaurant had a policy of not seating a party until everyone was there, they should have said so. If they choose to break their rule then they should stick by their decision. It was THE WORST I've ever been treated at a restaurant and left me with the impression they only cared about getting as much money as they could. Money over customer satisfaction. Bad - bad - bad! We took our whole party over to Horsefeathers and had one of the best nights of our life. Needless to say we had a rather large dining bill and were more than happy to leave a very large tip for the waiter - too bad Bellini's missed out.
Food was excellent. Materdei was distracted. Dining room was half empty while customers were left waiting at the bar (at $7/drink) for long periods of time. Couldn't find a waiter to get my check. When the check was delivered (given to my wife on Valentines day!) it was for 4 instead of 2 persons. Quickly corrected, though. Coat check took 5 minutes to find our coats!
Are you kidding me? This is a Sanibel "tourist trap", I live in SRQ and this place would go out of business in say, Sarasota, Naples or even Clearwater.... skip this one, okay?
This calssic diner is a Myrtle Beach icon. Known to frequent guests as "the flame". Omelettes are large enough to share. Friendly, attentive waitstaff. Should be on every visitor's list when spending time onthe Grand Strand.
Our waitress was rude. We had to constantly ask her to refill our drinks. We practically had to beg her to take our food order. The lobsters were a little tough. Also, another waitress told us in a nasty tone to move our bags since she had people (her words, not mine). She should have said. Please move your bags as I have a table of four to seat, with a thank you. Then the bill of $165. came & we were told they accepted cash only. I believe this should have been stated on the menus.
Dear readers, lived in N'Orleans for 13 years, married to a native, and I've cooked my share of Cajun Cuisine  I know what I speak of here. We traveled 200 miles to have a reunion type dinner with friends from N'Orleans, and felt cheated. Want to know why? Read on then. PapaDeaux's decor was reminiscent of N'Orleansthe wait was not. The only place in N'Orleans I can remembering waiting this long, (over 1 hour) AND without drinks being offered, (what were they thinking????) is at Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen. There you fight for parking, then wait in line outside for forty-five minutes to an hour to get his notorious "blackened" fish dishes. But, to give Paul credit, he has the intelligence to make money off his captured audience by plying them with drinks during their wait. What better way to keep people from walking off, than put a glass of Chablis in their hand? But I digress  We waited in the open courtyard, which was pretty nippy in May 2002, and I imagine would be pretty drippy in the hot summer months, and listen to what they HOPED would be authentic N'Orleans music  Not! Yep, they missed on the one too. Sure, all the notes were right from the pages of the jazz and blues greats of the Big Easy, but that was the problem. The musicians were reading the music instead of playing it from the heart, which everyone knows is the real secret of N'Orleans entertainment. Where was the passion and spontaneity? Maybe I am just spoiled, but if you're trying to give people a taste of N'Orleans, don't do it halfway! Make sure the musicians are seasoned enough to play at the stuff like they love it, or keep with the canned music. When we were called for seating we wowed at the lobsters in their tank and smiled at the bar filled with couples nuzzled together closely. As we sat down to have our OWN conversation, we understood why. Apparently, in a terribly misguided notion of authenticity, PapaDeaux's has decided to leave their dining rooms open, with acoustics seemingly designed to increase the noise level of a person's voice by three. The only way sweet-nothings can be shared here is by screaming into each other's ears! The din in the room was enough to set off the car alarms outside! When you have a party of seven, as we did this night, seated around a great round table, there is not such thing as conversation. It's a shouting match with the tables around you. My hubby complained his ears were still ringing the next morning! As far as the food goes, it had reasonably authentic N'Orleans flavor for a chain restaurant, but unreasonably overpriced what I would expect to pay at Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen. Dinner will run about $15 to $20 bucks per person easy, and that's without appetizers, drinks or dessert. Hey, you guys in the Papadeaux corporate office, if you're trying to make a restaurant for the hearing disabled, you've done a fine job. If not listen up. This serious flaw can easily be corrected, AND double seating capacity, thereby lowering wait times, increasing revenue, adding more charming decor, and reducing the "roar" effect to a manageable rumble. But I get the feeling you fella's think this is kewl, huh? Now tell the truth ... this is completely intentional, isn't it, and you Blue suits have no intentions of solving it? Guys, give me a call if you change your mind, cause I ain't about to darken your doors again until you do. And my big mouth will advise everyone else to do the same.

Food was acceptable. Service people were pleasant. Their was arguing by the management in the back that was heard by many and made for a disturbing experience. I will not be back.
El Torero offers an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet for $9.00 on weekdays.Certain items on the buffet were quite good,such as the cheese enchiladas and the jalapeno poppers.The poppers were prepared expertly with a crisp outer crust enclosing a perfectly seasoned and creamy interior.The chicken chimichongas were also decent,but the beef chimichongas left much to be desired.The onions in the steak fajita filling were raw and bitter in flavor.The soft and hard tacos,the beans, the Mexican rice,as well as the rest of the selections on the buffet were basically more like one would expect to find at Taco Bell,not at a real Mexican restaurant. Another problem was that the entire restaurant was being run by one woman who was acting as greeter,bartender and waitress.She was doing an admirable job of juggling these responsibilities,but the patron behind us did get forgotten about for about 15 minutes.We may try El Torero again just to see if this visit offered a true glimpse of their establishment or if it was "just one of those days".
This restaurant is new and in our neighborhood, and we had high hopes that this could become our regular weekend breakfast place; unfortunately, it was terrible. The potatoes were barely cooked, and most of the food was cool when it arrived from the kitchen (in the back of the restaurant). The "sausage" was simply awful; it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, and was rubbery. The cinnamon roll wasn't too bad, but it was incredibly tiny, a little too doughy, and was $2. The only high note was that the coffee wasn't too bad.
Great atmosphere, bad service.
I think Angelina's is the closest to home cooking out of any Italian restaurant I've ever been to. Although the service is not up to par, the food overshadows it. You kind of feel like you are in Grandma's living room and the food really makes it feel that way!
Where to start... We were in Ottawa for the weekend and we went to Oregano's for lunch on a Saturday and found the $9.95 buffet to be bland, understocked and lacking in vegetarian friendly fare...One of the buffet dishes was Kraft Dinner! - carefully disguised as Scoobi Doo pasta with ham and cheese! The potato soup in the buffet was good. Since I didn't like the look of the buffet, I ordered the cheese manicotti for $14. What I got was two tubes of pasta smothered in rubbery mozzarella cheese that you had to saw through... There was no salad, no bread stick, nothing for the $14 but the two small pasta tubes... I also ordered an appetizer - Bruschetta. The bruschetta was $6 and consisted of three small pieces of Focaccia which together made up less than half of the circular loaf. There was easily twice as much onion in the bruschetta topping as there was tomato and since the same tough & rubbery cheese was melted on top, the topping was hot like the bread - not how its supposed to be. For drinks we had a wide variety: hot chocolate which came without whipped cream; chocolate milk which appeared to be made from Brown Cow syrup; a rye and ginger ale which was moderately priced at $3.50, a pint of beer that appeared to be less than a full pint; and a diet pepsi which came to the table in a can and appeared on the bill for $2.25! $2.25 for a can of pop!!! I'm sure this sounds like nothing more than sour grapes but honestly, this was the worst restaurant I have been to in years, anywhere. Poor food and very poor value. I've been to much more expensive restaurants and left feeling like I got good value, here we left feeling like we'd fallen into a tourist trap and been had. Our total LUNCH bill for four people with only 3 alcoholic drinks was $80! Oregano's was definitely the low point of my weekend in Ottawa.
Over the past several months we have visited 3 Connecticut Hometown Buffet locations.We were pleasantly surprised by our experience with their Waterbury,Ct location and we were extremely dissatisfied with their Milford,Ct location.(Please see our reviews of these locations for the specific details.)This location,in Wethersfield,Ct fell somewhere in the middle.Being that our visit was on a Friday,many seafood choices were available on their buffet.Their "Boston Crumb Baked Fish" fillets were delicious.Their regular fried shrimp were also pretty good.Their "Buffalo Wing Seasoned Popcorn Shrimp" were unusual,but not necessarilly in a bad way.Their "Ultimate Seafood Stew" would have been better served as a sauce for pasta.Their "Honey Barbecue Chicken" was better than that served to us at KFC the last time that we went there!Being that this location is somewhat smaller than the others that we have visited,their buffet choices and,especially,their dessert choices,were somewhat less varied.They were very short on their low-sugar dessert choices.They did,however,have both Diet Coke and Diet Sprite! We were actually impressed when one of their female employees assisted a handicapped woman by serving her from the buffet.I was not impressed,however,by the cleanliness and state of repair of their men's bathroom.I was even less impressed as I was using the bathroom just before we were leaving when one of their employees,in uniform,rushed into the men's room and was violently ill in one of the stalls!My wife overheard that this employee had shown up intoxicated for work while I was using the facilities.This location has potential,but definitely needs some "polishing"!
Prices comparable to Uncle Tai's (Boca Center) without the ambience or quality. The owner should take lessons in management, My wife (handicapped) was struggling with her coast prior to seating I wasn't near her} when the owner went by without a glance. Asking two tables (old customers) if everything is ok and ignoring all the surrounding tables doesn't make for good customers and there wasn't a thank you for coming as we left him standing at the reception desk. Would I go back after two trries with similar episodes....NO and the food is pedestrian...comparable to any mom and pop operation (who say thank you when you leave)
Had lunch today with two friends at 227. I ordered the Salmon Club which took 1/2 to arrive. The middle was raw and fleshy. I sent the meal back only to wait another 1/2 hour for it to return. In the meantime my friends had finished their lunches. One had the Portabello sandwich, good. The other had a chicken pasta, chicken overcooked. We had two waiters (one was the owner I believe, he never so much as said boo to us, the other only grunted in our direction), neither one barely acknowledged us. Our water was never replenished and we were never asked if we wanted anything else to drink. I ended up having my salmon wrapped to take home (which took another 15 minutes). In my previous life before having my son I traveled with my job and have eaten at many, many excellent restaurants across the country. I can without a doubt say, 227 Bistro had the worst service I have ever experienced. It is really too bad, the place has an exceptional atmosphere. The staff, however, could care less that you are there! I can't imagine this establishment surviving on their looks alone. What a disappointment!
I suspect I'm biased against this place due to food poisoning  I was fine when I went in, but felt increasingly queasy during the meal, and was ready to vomit by the time I left. (No, we did not drink with dinner!) I made it back to the hotel, but was violently sick three times through out the night. The next morning I was fine. As soon as we were seated, the waiter brought us two "Special complementary appetizers." One was a thick veggie soup, and the one I ate was a tiny ground lamb patty. Since we shared everything else, and my partner escaped unharmed, I blame this free bit of lamb. I wonder if it was a leftover from a previous special, or if they always do these freebies. In any case, I believe that it was sitting about at an unhealthy temperature for too long.
It is not the food quality that Sunset Restaurant need to improve. They need to develop better people skills.
Ultimately, I was very disappointed after reading the other reviews on this site. Basically, our server's attitude can at best be described as indifferent. The pasta special was ourageously priced (more than 2 times most of the other pasta dishes) which was a suprise we only learned about only after getting the bill. On the positive side, the wall of candles was nice as was the fresh bread. In the end, I doubt we will return here again.
Rude employees. Bartenders are the worst. An extremely local hang-out. If not a friend of the crew, be prepared to wait, and no friendly attitudes. Bar top a mess, and always wet. Best thing is the T.V's showing sports. Live music there is o.k, not great. Some nice decor, and there are pool tables with room to play. More for the just turning 21 crowd.
The food was good, but the server whose name was Kate ( which is on her name tap )was treaded me very bad, she looked like mad about me, i don't understand why.
Just horrible. These people don't know how to run a business. Who wears ties to the kind of place they are running. I think this place needs something changed. They know nothing about a restaurant. The owner came over and apolegized for our bad night but he looked like he just stepped out of some Italian Restaurant movie. He didn't know how to cook food (hes the cook). His waiters only speak spanish and russian. This place needs to be out. If you follow one piece of adice follow this. Don't go to Porcinis
The food was fair but portions were small. I actually have similar comments about the manager Steve. We had 3 toddlers at the table. One of the toddlers took the napkin off the other table. the manager , Steve, kept on coming by with dirty looks. I offered to pay for the 3 paper napkins but he said that children should never act that way. It is definately not a child friendly place. It was a very poor experience
The Sunday Buffet is located on U.S. 1 about a half mile east of Stew Leonard's dairy store in Norwalk Connecticut.We have been thinking about trying them for quite a long while.Unfortunately,after shopping at Stew Leonard's we are usually too full of samples to even think about lunch!Yesterday Stew's was kind of stingy with the samples so we gave the Sunday Buffet a try.Some items on their $5.99 lunch buffet were pretty good,such as the General's Chicken,the Sesame Chicken and the chicken with black pepper.The stuffed mussels,while not particularly attractive to the eye,were downright delicious!Unfortunately,the Crab Rangoon filling was oversweetened and watery,the spring and egg rolls lacked flavor,the wontons were hard and undercooked and the cocktail shrimp were overcooked and mushy.It was nice that they did have shrimp,however.The food does have good potential if they work on it's weak points.The decor was a little bit too "utilitarian" and the waitress could have been a bit more attentive.Overall this restaurant is unremarkable,hence our giving it average ratings in all categories.
Many friends had described the Hudson International Buffet to me as one of the best restaurants there is. I went there to inspect for myself and brought along two friends, hoping for a delicious meal and expecting the best. I ended up leaving halfway through and relocating to a better restaurant. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted by a crabby hostess who seemed to angry to care whether or not I said "hello" or "how are you". I was snubbed and directed to a booth where I was greeted again with coldness. "Maybe it's just me", I had pondered but soon came to realize that they were that way to every customer whether to my rear or to my sides. And then, the buffet. I got a plate full only to find that two black hairs were already cooked and inside both the Lo Mein and the General Tso's Chicken. When I had spoken to one of the Waitresses, she had merely ignored my complaint and acted as if she never heard me. though the atmosphere was okay, I was not treated to fine dining or even average dining. The food was all either too salty, or not flavored enough and the seafood tasted at least a few days old. I also have recently found out that one time when they were closed (before that disastrous day I had tried to go once) for one or two days, it was due to them failing a health inspection. Indeed, their food is not fresh. or clean. I recommend for no one to go there and go to other great places I've gone to since like the China Buffet by T.J. Maxx or The Imperial Buffet. I personally enjoy the China Buffet very much.
Food has gone way down-hill. Service is really slow. Bartenders all have extreme attitude problems. Terrible management problems. Please consider this a warning and avoid this place at all costs. It is basically your typical tourist trap. The only thing it has going for it is it's waterfront location. What a waste...
Terrible service ! Bad food ! Worst Indian dining experience on Westside!
We ordered out. The business office bought lunch for the office staff and this restaurant was definitely below health standards much less food for human consumption. A used bandage was left in my "Creole Seafood Pasta" and Hoolihan's management would not acknowledge the problem and their headquarters accused us of "always trying to get free food". Hoolihan's are hooligans and this dealership will never eat there again!!!!!!!!!!
This is a follow up review to the one posted a year ago. I ventured into Mr. Azteca's again recently to see if anything had changed. To my surprise - the service has greatly improved. They still decide to charge you a price based on who you are (i.e. Latino= $5 flautas; Non-Latino=$12 flautas), but they must have taken a look at We8there.com or attended a class on customer service. I even came back into the restaurant 2-4 minutes after getting my To-Go bag and asked them for "mas queso y guacamole, por favor" (more cheese & guac) and the lady SMILED and said, "Sure, one second". WOW! A SMILE?! What a turn around. I even offered to pay for the extra cheese but she refused. Even though I just paid $12 dollars for 8 Flautas, I was still pleased with the change in customer service. In all fairness, I believe that their Overall score can be changed to a 3 1/2.
I'll have to disagree with Ms. Kitago's take on at least one part of the evening. I believe the chicken tikka masala was slightly dry. Decent portion, but not succulent as i am accustomed to. In addition, the gulub jaman is served cold, anathema to this diner. I will agree with Ms. K that the mango lassi was delicious, but overall I believe her review was slightly inflated
the food was actually incredible in taste. Tha ratio of portion size to cost was out of balance. I thought the portion size could have been bigger. I left hungry~ Our waitress was a delight, she was great. Id consider going back if there was a change in portion size.
Janna- Perhaps you should have mentioned that you work there. Not exactly an unbiased opinion. Overpriced food and drinks. Nine dollars for a glass of wine!
A week before Christmas, I visited (for the first time) Todai in Cupertino. The food was ok, not great, just ok. I understand time is an issue when preparing food for a buffet; however, all of the items at the sushi buffet were thick, poorly cut pieces of fish on unseasoned rice. I tried the baked lobster and had an allergic reaction ten minutes later. I'm not allergic to lobster, just shrimp. On my way past the lobster buffet, there was a sign (right next to the lobster sign) in small print that said, "Due to the shortage of lobster this year, we will be serviing jumbo shrimp.". The shrimp were huge, enough for many to think that it was lobster, since it was baked in a heavy cheese sauce that smothered it. A word to the wise. Those of you looking for a wonderful seafood restaurant would be better off spending your money at a better, safer, and worthwhile restaurant. The cost is virtually the same and your stomach and family will thank you. Go somewhere where they care about what they're preparing. It makes all the difference!
Terrible service, no customer service and the food not that great. Had to wait for an hour and a half for simple sandwiches and salads. Waiters terrible. Been there twice, same story, will not go back. TERRIBLE.
Terrible servise. Chief was rude my hubby after he complained about bad memory of our waiter!!! Unbelievable. Waiter happened to be his son, and guy obviously have some huge ego problems. Stay away from this place.
The food was not at all what I had expected! I had to send my steak back 4 times and they still were unable to cook it correctly. so the food was terrible! Now the service, my server was Michelle she works at the Santa Fe off of 74th and Penn. She was rude, drinks were not refilled, she did not cater to us at all. I just thought that when you go to a restaurant you are supposed to enjoy it. From the exprience that I had, I never want to go to any Santa Fe again. Also I ask to speak with one of the managers , the manager that I talked to was named Margi... I am not sure but she came to the table and acted like she was very uninterested in our problems with our food and when she was walking away from the table she said a few abscenities that I care not to repeat. I am not usually like this but was very upset from he exprience, all I wanted to do was go eat and it be enjoyable. Well thank you for your time reading this. I am telling everyone that I know not to go to Santa Fe Cattle Company.
Yesterday we visited the Friendly's restaurant in Danbury with our good friend Marie and her daughters Donna and Gina. All of the adults had the South-Western Chicken sandwich platters.The sandwiches were quite good and the fries, though slightly overcooked, also were very satisfying. (I,for one,actually preferred the extra crunchy fries!)The only concern that we had was when we had to remind the waitress twice about Donna's Shirley Temple beverage. She also took quite a while to fetch refills for the rest of us! Overall, we had a pleasant experience here.
My party consisted of 11 people who had never dined at Morton's before, but do frequent upscale restaurants on a regular basis. We were all curious about the menu and almost everyone ordered something different so we could sample everything. The atmosphere was pleasant but extremely hot. One feature of Morton's is that the waitstaff recites the ENTIRE menu tableside and shows examples of the cuts of meat you can order. I understand how it could make a diner feel special but, I felt more like a spectacle. The appetizers were flavorful yet very small. The Shrimp Alexander app. consisted of 3 small shrimp. Salads were next and very disappointing. Virginians are proud of their Hanover County tomatoes and; with this in mind, the beefsteak salad in winter was a pale, mushy, tasteless disaster. Four thick slices of unripe beefsteak tomato drizzed with a mild dressing will not be well received by devoted Richmond tomato fans. The other salads were also not enjoyed by my dinner party. As an entree, I dined on the Steak Au Poivre, which was not done in classic style- instead, had a peppery cream sauce drizzled over a bare New York sirloin. This was different than expected but still enjoyable and cooked to temperature. The lady across the table sent her steak back 2 times- originally ordering medium-well and having it brought to her rare and bloody. The man next to me ordered the Sicilian Veal Chop, which was over-cooked. The Swordfish steak was overcooked and dry. The crab cakes were excellent! Every side we ordered was for 2 people and very large. They all came to the table cold. We were given different batches of the creamed spinach. One dish was perfect while the others were unpleasantly loaded with garlic. The lack of consistency in a chain restaurant upsets me... as you never know what you will get the next time you visit. Hot desserts had to be ordered at the beginning of the meal so as to allow preparation time. We ordered a few Raspberry and Grand Marnier Souffles. These were tasted and left to deflate since everyone was busy attacking the hot Godiva cake, with rich sauce oozing onto the plate! It was a delicious, traditional, chocolatey end to a meal and it would be my only reason for ever going back to Morton's in Richmond.
Fire the cook!!! The greens were extremely hot with large lumps of coarse black pepper and red pepper, the chitterlings were vinegary with too much red pepper. Fried chicken lacked seasoning and was fried too fast and too hard. This restaurant and the Mitchellville branch has highly seasoned food that would not be suitable for a diabetic or one that has hypertension. This would be unfortunate for one that has spent money as I did only to have to come home, rinse the greens and chitterlings several times, recook the food in clear water and the meal was still not fit to eat. I have been unsatisfied for the past five visits to Henry's. Each time I gave them the benefit of the doubt and returned to patronize the restaurant. It is sad that a such a good restaurant has gone bad. Service was excellent, the food was not edible.
After reviewing many other reviews on this establishment, they all said that the menu contained many local seafood dishes and meat items like prime rib. The closest thing to fresh local seafood was the frozen popcorn shrimp (stay away). The same seasoning (marinade?) was used on the beef for both the Baja Steak Taco and the Philly Cheese steak. The menu was sub par with a hamburger the nearest thing to Prime Rib. Good place for a drink, but if you are looking for a decent dinner location, you better slug down a couple of drinks before tackling the fare here.
This restaurant was previously known as Rosetti's. After a brief dormant period, it opened with a different name, but same menu and decor. It is family friendly and offers a large selection of pizza, pasta, chicken and veal dishes. The wine list has many options under $20, and also a list of Reserve bottles.
Really great grinders...the pizza's OK. You really gotta go to this place for the sandwhiches
With a table next to you, chain smoking on purpose just to bother you, would you enjoy that experience. Even after asking the waitress to do something, nothing changed. We then asked for the owner and he did not bother to even come out of the back room. Later we were told by the waitress that most of their clientele are smokers. We looked around and those were the only two people in the restaurant smoking. It was a terrible experience and I will not go back.
I first started going to Mr. Azteca's from the advice of a friend who loves it there. I have been to this place 3 times thinking "well, maybe I just got them on a bad day" - that isn't the case. This has GOT to be THEE sorriest excuse for a Mexican restaurant that I have EVER experienced! For starters, the service is unbelievably poor! One of the servants always has a snotty look on her face and doesn't look me in the eyes. She openly talks about the guests in Spanish thinking that no one will understand her . (C'mon, this is California, Spanish is the 2nd dominant language!). 2nd: The dish that I tried actually wasn't that bad; chicken taquitos. The meat is the same chicken they use for the enchiladas so there is a hint of enchilada sauce mixed in with the meat. However; all three times I have been there my order was wrong! At first I thought maybe I am ordering wrong, but it doesn't take a skilled linguist to clearly enunciate " 2 Chicken Taquitos with Guacamole and Cheese"! Today just topped it off: I don't eat beef AT ALL but somehow "4 chicken taquitos" was interpreted as "4 Steak Carne Asadas"!! What the hell?! 3rd: The prices are different depending on the customer! If they like you you get everything for a dollar. Tacos, enchiladas, taquitos - $1.00 each - but if they give you the snotty look and a smirked lip, then you're paying for every spoonful of guacamole, full price for the tacos, and $.85 for the cheese!! I am so happy there is a place like We8there.com for me to vent!!! If anyone else has been to this place please post your review, thanks!
Classic American Steak house. Many cuts of large steaks are offered. One salmon dish is on the menu. All sides are served ala carte but are large enough to share. Wine list is priced resonable. Everything was good but nothing was outstanding.
The place was under construction and had a weird smell to it. The waitress seemed overwhelmed but there was a LOT of staff there so I'm not sure what the problem was. We are enjoying checking out the funky diners on the east coast but can't advise anyone to rush to try this one. Sounds like it's gotten a BIT better than when the previous reviewer was there - but not much.
We dined at Cochon Sauvage on a Sunday night. We arrived at 8:00 p.m to find the entire restaurant dead. Not to mention the look of irration on the servers face (they close at 9:00). The entire time we felt completly rushed. The staff even started taking stuff apart and closing while we were still on our entree. The food was average and the server had lack of knowledge. I have read other reviews about the rude grey haired man. Obiviously these owners are completely arrogant. Which they shouldn't. A Sunday night and there are only 3 people in the restaurant?
For $230.00 we expected a memorable dining experience. The atmosphere was so so. They didn't even have valet parking.
Although we asked to be seated in Non-smoking, we were sat in smoking section AND next to the bar. Food was OK at best, nothing spectacular. Service was also middle-of-the-road. May go again, simply because I usually give a place 2 shots.
Small, ecclectic open kitchen restaurant. Plastic covers provide nice outside seating. Great flavors and spices enhance the meal.
The waiter was great! The manager and other waitresses were very rude!
HELP! if someone sees this within the Bowie area, please I could just scream, I just have to let you know. I had an aweful experience. I decided, since it was Holiday, to treat some of the younger generation within my family, to a nice meal, and a movie. The movie "Maid In Heaven" was very good! However, prior to that we went over to the TGIF within the Town Center. 1. We waited 10 minutes, after being seated, before I asked for our server. 2. We received no water! 3. So naturally, the hostess that I am, I allowed my guess to order what they wanted. They chose the hi-ended items. 4. Finally we met our server, and, he apologized, explaining that they were in the back figuring out who was going to serve who. 5. Dah!!! TMI - too much info, I don't want to know that. 6. I want to be served. I explained that we were going to the movies across the lot. I ordered soup, I got no spoon! 7. The soup came with my entree, however, it was just liquid. 8. I returned it asking for a better serving, It was luke warm. 9. All the entrees ordered were either burned, or cooked twice. 10. It was awful. I displayed it all to the manager, and he gave me a DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, HE SHOULD HAVE WAIVED THE ENTIRE MEAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm over with that CHAIN for a while. I was embarrased, it was supposed to be a treat. My guess were not impressed, and it reflected BAD on part, for making such a selection to dine in. :-( vthomas4513@yahoo.com
Several weeks back we had read an article in the New Haven Advocate praising the donuts at Hole Scoop. Their donuts are produced automatically by a "robot" (which is some sort of a local attraction) and we were informed in the article that one should arrive early in the morning in order to see the "robot" in operation and to enjoy the donuts while they are at their hot and fresh best. This past Sunday we arrived at 7 AM only to find the "robot" still fast asleep and the donuts cold and apparently leftover from Saturday. We purchased a couple of the very small donuts for 80 cents each and we were not at all impressed with them! They were marginally better than those nasty things that "Krispy Kreme" sells, but not much! Perhaps we would have liked them better if they hadn't been leftover, but if they don't have fresh donuts at 7 AM on a Sunday morning, when do they? We may give them another try if we are in the area, but we would not make another trip just for their donuts!
Definetly will never go here again. The food was over priced and the menu was overworded. No one at our table was impressed to say the least.
As a party of 7 people, we could only make a reservation for after 8pm. We were out for a special occasion, so wanted to eat outside. We were told the wait would be 35-45 minutes. Fine, we got drinks... an hour and 10 minutes later, someone from our party inquired about our table. Once seated, service was slow and at times unprofessional for a restaurant where you hope to have a nicer than average meal. We didn't get food until almost 10pm. They had a live jazz ensemble there, but the music was way too loud for a typical conversation to occur. Don't believe the reviews from people saying that they had great steaks here - this is Omaha people! You can go anywhere and get "great" steak! The river was beautiful and the food okay. I'm going to try really hard to not go back there.
You woule be better off going to Del Taco. The service at Latigo Kid is unacceptable and the food is nothing to write home about. In fact, you probably could send it home and it would be the same temperature as when you receive it in the resturant. And to top off the terrible food and service the atmosphere is just sort of a dump.
We sat for a half an hour before even getting a drink order. The waitress had a party of 10 then us and other tables in the restaurant. Then another 20 minutes before she took the order, because other party was so demanding. Our salads came out with the other people food and before we even got our salads they sat on the tray at least 10 minutes. The waitress had people help bring the food out but no one stayed to help pass out. We got our food with the next 20 minutes, it was good. I did ask to speak to a manager. I had told her that the first thing was this waitress should have never been given the two parties back to back unless someone was going to help. I then told her that before things even started, it took her a half an hour before coming over to our table to get a drink order. The manager's words were "the problem you people's party is that when you party doesn't show up all at once" I cut her off because the first thing is you don't blame the customer because our party didn't show up all together. I never complained about the wait in the lobby. I basically rolled her eyes at me. She talked to me like I didn't know what I was talking about. I told I have been in the restaurant business and retail for over 10 years. All I explained to her was that the waitress should of had more help and unfortunately she did not get it. From what I understand this waitress was in tears earlier. She had had four complaints that night already because of other parties. I don't blame all of it on the waitress I blamed management for no team work. Will never go there again.
Housed in large, glass walled buildinng with a nice view on the fishing port. A bit noisy but comfortable overall. Food is very good and focuses on fresh fish. You can not miss the "spaghetti ai frutti di mare", an enormous dish of spaghetti with seafood, an outstanding piece cof cooking.
We recently visited this Hometown Buffet location on a Sunday morning to try their breakfast buffet.My wife enjoyed their freshly made donuts and was especially thrilled that ice cream and soda were still available despite the fact that we were having breakfast.(Since she is an adult she can have whatever she wants for breakfast,I guess!) I stuck mainly to the more "traditional" breakfast items.I especialy enjoyed their chicken-fried steak with country gravy.Overall the selection here was so large that everybody should be able to find something to their liking.One thing that we have always liked about this specific location is that they have caffeine-free diet Sprite as well as the more commonly offered caffeinated Diet Coke available on their drink bar.
Not good. Had to wait 15 minutes just to get a menu. One waitress for the work of three. Seated next to a smelly restroom. They screwed up our order three times. No coffee or drink refills offered. Food cold by the time we got it. We'll never go back.
We heard about the hype of this place, and were told that, for a French, this was the place to be - OUCH! Pastries were hard and raw, apparently from hours earlier. So-called "Douce France" doesn't give locals anything French nor sweet as the name suggests. Another tourist trap to me. Also we went to observe a French conversation group - meeting every Friday night. These looked like people avid of all-French things - but they obviously don't eat pastries :-)
Food very late coming (60-90 minutes). Food was cold in some circumstances. Food made me sick the next day.
Mixed drinks were so watered down the ice didn't even melt. As a group I be we dropped alot of money for what we DID NOT get. When we asked a manager about the drinks, he admitted that they do not put vodka in some of the drinks that you can't tell weather it's in there or not. One couple spent $80.00 on drinks and were so disgusted they left. The bar tender was taken care of every round and I am sure was just doing her job but DAMN come on.....I must say there were alot of nice looking people there dressed HOTT....The music was a little too blah, the place is aswesome looking but that's about as deep as it does. I know our lil party or 8 won't break them but not going back but it was like just being robbed of you cash.
There's no lying, the food here is good. Unfortunately, thats the only thing that is. The entree size is the most disappointing. A $14 dish has about 1/2 of what other similarly priced restaurants have. The seating is crowded. The atmosphere has very poor accoustics. What I thought would be an awesome place to take mom and dad turned out to be a nightmare...we couldn't even hear each other and were sitting just a few feet away. The food is good, but everything else sucks.
We posted a review of the Shady Maple Smorgasbord back in November of 2003 and gave our honest opinion as to the quality of their establishment.We stand by our opinion that not only was the food bland,but that most of it was not even freshly prepared and was of a mass-produced,pre-packaged nature.We have been visiting Pennsylvania and the Pennsylvania Dutch region annually for the last 11 years,and despite what the previous reviewer has to say,we do appreciate the cooking styles unique to the region.We expect freshly-prepared dishes lightly seasoned so that one tastes the true flavors of the ingredients,not just the spices.We do not,however,expect a true Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant to serve food that would be more suitable for the Hometown Buffet.Both my maternal and paternal grandmothers were excellent cooks in their own ways,but if one of them had prepared food of the type served at the Shady Maple Smorgasbord I would have wondered which industrial kitchen she was employed at!We are not saying that the food here was disgusting,just not what we expected after all that we had heard over the years.We are just stating our opinion that,of the dozens of restaurants that we have dined at in the region over the past 11 years,the Shady Maple Smorgasbord was the most disappointing. This is a forum where we are all free to give voice to our opinions on any given restaurant.We have no problem if someone disagrees with our opinion and wants to post their own conflicting review.Please,however,do not call into question our knowledge of various styles of cuisine.We take great effort to be fair in our opinions.Sometimes we are probably too lenient.Thank you.
I went to the Villa Tronco with a group of friends. I am a college student at USC, as are they. It was a friend's birthday dinner. There were seven of us. I understand that reservations were made for eight. The food is fairly expensive, although, not unreasonable for a small Italian restaurant located in the city. I was in the mood for pasta and a number of us were watching our wallets. Most of us ended up ordering the same or similar dishes. The salad arrived. Although it was small, it was fine with a light lemony dressing. The taste and freshness whetted us for the entree. Our drinks were not full, our waitress had no personality, she never checked on us, or came to ask us how we were--all the usual things that wait staff does. The entrees arrived. The food was awful. I almost sent mine back on the spot but decided against it because I didn't want to detract from the birthday spirit. I should have sent it back. The pasta although not mushy was waterlogged, incredibly bland, and probably wasn't even semolina. I had a combination plate hoping that I could sample some delicious ravioli, lasagna, and rigatoni in their respective sauces. The tomato sauce was a diluted tomato puree that certainly lacked tomato flavor and had no herbs or spice. None. The lasagna had no flavor, and I could not bring myself to eat it with its mushy blobs of browned hamburger (not likely that it was even ground chuck). The cream sauce on the rigatoni was light and pleasant even if the pasta itself was anything but. The garnish was a sprinkle of parsley that was in the cream sauce on the rigatoni. So it wasn't actually garnish. The presentation on-the-whole was awful. It looked like a cafeteria plate. My friend had the eggplant parmesan of which she could only eat half although she hadn't eaten. She paid so much for it that she took the other half of the miniscule portion home and ate it this morning as breakfast because of monetary guilt and spite. Another friend of mine described her food as "gross" with "watery tomato" from a can. Another offered her sympathy because she didn't have the meatballs to "break it up." I think you get the picture. Fortunately, the birthday girl enjoyed her dish that was some $20-something dollar creation. I would gladly have paid a little more if only I had known. I planned to speak to the manager to express my displeasure, but had every intention of paying (and none of tipping). Our checks came. Gratuity had been added. Our party of seven were seated in separate booths, served at different times. The gratuity was a surprise and a shock. The 20% addition to the bill unjustified. One of the checks was calculated wrong. I spoke to manager and asked the gratuity be removed. It was minor, but it was at least $3.00 on our checks. It would have made us more content. I explained the lack of presentation, the waitress who gave us no attention, the empty drinks, the bad food, the server who asked "Who had the eggplant parm?" I explained that we weren't served as a party or seated as one. I got nowhere. I was told more or less that we had been done a favor by getting reservations because they were busy. There were at least three empty booths immediately surrounding us. There was no bustle, no wait, no one eating. I was told that whoever made the reservations understood the arrangement. I told them that they had expected we would have been served together. I explained the entire party's discontent and disappointment. Surely, reservations are not a contract that says the diners must be pleased with the dining and service. I was told that because my friend had gotten a free piece of cheesecake I was in no place to complain. And lastly, I was told that I had an excellent waitress. I thought about causing a seen but could see that Carmella (the manager) was likely to escalate the situation to something inappropriate. We were forced to tip the bad waitress, given no respect as costumers, given no compensation for our discontent, and made to pay for slop that any fast food chain could produce if they went Italian. I have had poor dishes, but this amount of disrespect is new. Olive Garden does it better.
I think the above reviewers work there because these reviews sound very bias if not too over the top. I dined at this restaurant the other night with a couple of my buddies, and while the food was merely good, maybe just alright, I would never consider this an overwhelming dining experience. The restaurant was there and we chose it. Would I go there or any of the other Hamburger Hamlets again? Maybe, if it was the only restaurant available. The cost of the food and drinks didn't necessarily match the quality of the product and service. Maybe I am wrong, but I really think the previous reviewers were employees needing some business.
"My family and I are very glad we found this restaurant, its nice, clean, the buffet is full of great food, and they even do FREE delivery !"
It was one of the worst experiences I had ever had. The food was all dried up and tasted a few days old wihle the fruit contained sand and hair in it. I almost barfed when I tried their Snow Crab legs. Their food is terrible, the service is completely wasted and the atmosphere is very unoriginal. I would never return to it and advise all others to do the same. I personally now enjoy the China Buffet Restaurant in Hudson PLaza by T.J. Maxx. I also dislike the Dragon BUffet and the King Buffet.The China Buffet provides excellent service and I love it's delicious true Asian and western Delacacies. Thumbs down for Hudson, Dragon and King BUffet.
Weird place. There's an inside dining area....but it was locked. You had to order through the the window. It's not in a good part of town, but it's not the worst either and I was there in the middle of the afternoon. The food was alright. Nothing to brag about. I'm really not sure if I'd eat there again or not....the whole having everything locked up really tight made me uncomfortable.
This restaurant, Clay Oven, on Route 130 and opposite Renaissance Homes near Cranbury intersection really Sucks! The owners are absolutely mannerless. It seems they don't know how to do this business. They don't care about the customers. They don't know how to talk to the customers. The food is not at all worth paying for. Seems like they use the left overs or something or does not use proper material. The ambiance too is dull and boring. It is not at all worth going there and paying for that junk food. I did not get a proper service and then I ate there in the afternoon and by evening I was feeling sick and at night I was literally vomiting...the WORST place I have ever been. I highly recommend NOT to go there at all.
We stayed at the Perimeter Doubletree Hotel in Atlanta, GA several times because we were filming a plastic surgery documentary with a production co. hired by Discovery. So, the only convenient food was from the Dunwoody Bar & Grill in the hotel. (and Chin Chin's next door, but that is a different story) I can't say the food was really excellent, but what non-specialty restaurant in a hotel is? Also the service was so-so. It depended upon the server. The really tall guy in the bar area we liked a lot, I wish I could remember his name, but he always provided us with special-needs items due to our strict recovery protocol. Also, the restaurant manager was REALLY nice, every time he saw us he was so helpful, and pleasant and even let us sit in the bar area (the seats are more comfy and lean back a bit which was a plus due to our bodily states.) The female that we seems to get every time was bitter if you ask me. She had short curly hair I believe and I wanted to complain but I thought, ahh what difference does it make. The manager's and bartender's attitudes made up for any shortcomings. BTW you can get a buffet breakfast there I think for $10.95 or something like that and there is like a VAT of grits all for the taking. I love grits! The coffee was a bit cold, and the omelettes made with a greasy orange cheese, but hey it could have been a bad day. The oatmeal with raisins, cream and brown sugar was tasty :) Not sure if we will eat there again, as it depends upon if we decide to stay at Perimeter Doubletree again for our next follow-ups. But, food is food and when you are starving it will digest.
The neighborhood has watched with great interest for some months as this building was completely gutted and refurbished in preparation for the opening of this restaurant. I wish I could say it had been worth the wait. The renovated space is beautiful - spare, modern, elegant. The front patio was quite warm on the cold night we visited, and the pianist inside, though barely audible on the patio, is a nice touch. The service, while friendly and cordial (perhaps overly so, but the new kid tries harder) was abysmal. Our waiter appeared only occasionally, and the tables nearby did quite a bit of neck-craning as well. The server's scarceness seemed even more annoying in view of the glacial slowness with which our courses appeared. This is definitely not a restaurant to visit if you have theater tickets (unless you enjoy missing, at the very least, the first act). The food? We started with the ahi tartare, but the server brought us the cherry tomato/basil/olive tartlets instead. My fellow diner enjoyed them (I hate tomatoes, but they were comped). The ahi, when it finally arrived, was delicious, as was the clam chowder that eventually followed. I chose the paella as my main course; my companion had the monkfish. His was okay, I guess (he ate it all), but the paella was positively dismal. The rice was grainy, chalky even, and scorched as well. Uneatable. It was just as well, I guess; the long interval between the chowder and the entree had killed my appetite. So, bottom line. The renovation was worth the wait, but you'll want to give these folks a few months to get service, timing and food under control. If you enjoy being a guinea pig, though, this is the restaurant for you!
Oh you people! I have read your hateful reviews of this landmark restaurant and thought, "Yes, everything they say is true, but, everyone should eat at Joe's at least once". Why, if it is overpriced (and it is), crowded, the waiters (male please) rude, the service rushed, would I recommend that anyone eat there? Simply this, the experience. So now, grasshoppers, Zen and the art of eating at Joe's Stone Crab" First. It's gonna cost about $100 per person. That's just for the food, liquor is extra. Three hours average wait, that's three cocktails or frozen drinks while you schmooze and wait to be seated. Bring friends with whom you like to talk, you'll have plenty of time for conversation while you wait. Warn them in advance of what to expect. Don't bring friends who look at the host every ten minutes wondering how many names have been crossed off the list. They will soon get devil eyes and start acting like lunatics. Bring the ones who like to people watch. This is a great place to play "Celebrity Look Alike" (Hans Blix ladies and gentlemen). You might even see a real celebrity but don't get upset if they seat them ahead of everybody else, they are after all, JLo and Ben or P Diddy. Order these things and only these things. As a matter of fact, when the waiter brings the menu, look amazed and say, "I'll have my usual". This will throw the chap into a panic trying to remember who you are and will provide your tablemates with chuckles and appreciation of your wit. Anyway, back to your order. For openers, order Joe's Cole Slaw ($4). This stuff is very tangy, not sweet like I prefer, but it has a way of setting up your taste buds for the crab claws. If you like beer, order one at this point. For dinner, the large stone crab claws (about $39 per order), Lyonnaise Potatoes (hash browns with onions $5), and creamed spinach ($3). If after eating all of this, you are still hungry for claws, order a plate of the medium crab claws for the table ($20). Save room for dessert however, because this place makes great key lime pie ($5). Add coffee ($1.25) and that's a meal at Joe's. Now, about being rushed. Don't. You had to wait three hours, some other joker behind you has to wait his three. Talk, eat, drink, enjoy dining at the very first business opened by a Jewish person on Miami Beach. In 1913, Joe Weiss operated a lunch stand at Smith's bathing casino. From these humble beginnings came this gorgeous restaurant with people willing to wait hours to eat there. The menu which I just quoted you has been the standard dinner at Joe's since the 1920s. It was Joe's that introduced the stone crab to diners. Before Joe cooked and served them, no one ate them. Once a year I eat at Joe's. My friends at Carnival Corporation invite travel writers who cover their ships and companies to a dinner at Joe's. It is a gathering of seventy friends and collegues and we have a wonderful time and vow to meet again the following year. Get your head right before going to Joe's, bring lots of money, lose your inhibitions and have a great time.
On Tuesday night, September 30th, I brought a group of 7 adults and 1 child to the upstairs restaurant at 6:00 p.m. This was a "thank you" dinner to two Maui residents for their hospitality during our stay on the island. When I first told the residents here we were eating they seemed less than enthusiastic. They said they had dined at the restaurant before and were very put off by the "no printed menu" policy. They felt it was confusing and unhelpful in deciding on their meal. I mentally minimized their objection and proceeded with the reservation -- how much of a problem could it be? When we arrived a few minutes early we were told we would have to wait downstairs until 6:00 p.m. exactly. At 6:00 p.m. we were seated at a very nice location overlooking the ocean. The top of the table we were seated at was scratched and worn and did not present a good first impression. Our waiter arrived promptly and took our wine order. He then explained the "no printed menu" policy and went into an extensive explanation of what was offered. No prices were volunteered. He left and when he returned to take our order we went through another round of questions but this time he was questioned about some prices and food combinations. He explained the options of food, sauces, substitutes, side-dishes and prices as best he could but the situation was less than satisfactory and some in our party were still confused. We ordered. The appetisers and salads were served promptly. There was a long wait until the main courses were served. I would judge the food to be large in quantity and very average in taste. The presentation was fair-to-poor, with no color or garnishment on the plate. In summary, this was hardly a fine, up-scale dining experience. I've had Italian food in a local family restaurant that was three times as good at one-fifth the price. I visited the restroom. It was poorly maintained (dirty grout) and the sink fixtures were dated and dirty. I expect that your "no printed menu" policy is intended to create an ambience and establish the server as the diner's guide to a fine dining experience. What it came off as to me, because I paid the bill ($540), was an opportunity to disguise the high prices for ordinary dishes. I guess the truism is correct: you either get a beatiful view or fine dining expereince, not both.
No. 1 Chinese BBQ Restaurant Number One Local Boys Kauai Preliminaries: I am haole, that's not local. Locals are hapa, if they are not haole. Webster's Dictionary defines hapa haole, and haole, but not hapa alone. Haole in case you don't know, are those unlucky not to be Polynesian. Generally applied to mainlanders. When out and about Kauai, for those who pay attention to such things, on low riding small trucks and other teenage idles, can be seen window appliques of the logo: local boys or Kauai'i boys or West side boys. Doubtless, Spielberg, quintessentially attuned to boys and their growing-up, noted this local boy preoccupation culture whilst making his first Jurassic Park on Kauai. One more important element, local boys tend to the ali nui physique of the ancient Polynesians. That means, in short, massive. Number One I had missed till my hapa pal Owen recommended. Owen meets all the elements of local hapa, to be redundant. What's really important on Kauai? To the local boys its cars and food. Where do they put their money? Cars and food. The language for the two has become interchangeable. When first telling me about Number One, he described it as going to pound some food; and, if only sampled, then one has just dented the thing. Number One sits in an old drive-in by the Seven-11 stores on the main drag thru Lihue, same street where Ronald McDonald resides. Going to Number One, locally owned by Chinese for whom English remains a struggle, means you can hit the 7-11 for that Big Gulp bargain drink and then ding the menu a bit further at Number One. Eat-in or Take-out. Efficiently, local boys get the best buys at both locations. Owen describes the portions by gesture to show a plate satisfyingly filled to its edges. There lingers at the reflection a slight smile on his lips, and Owen repeats a paean to the size, whilst repeating the gesture. Note to reader: Owen comes to my shoulders, but I should guess our poundage equal. Owen further advises, one can order 1, 2, or 3 main choices with a choice of rice, including fryed rice, or noodles. "How" he exclaims for emphasis, "Can they do this for the price?" They must mean here the Chinese owners. Reflexively, I think for a moment of macro-economic things, wondering but should I call Alan Greenspan with this anecdotal report of price levels due to in-sourced Chinese cuisine. Or, can this but be a centuries' long trend with which the aging guru already incorporates to his broad vision? After all, I once read somewhere that, as the wag put it, in Manhattan, all Chinese cooking takes place in one vast subterranean kitchen, and then is brought to the surface for distribution. Probably, this is where that dig-a-hole-to-china story got started. Another item the CIA ought to look into. Back to Local. I ask Owen about L&L, one of what I think is a local place. He advises me dismissively, no local, but a franchise from Oahu. Note: L&L opens 24/7. But now Owen, going with the flow, glowingly tells of the Chicken Katsu, with genuine fondness he takes the time to describe the dish in detail. Boneless chicken pieces battered and fried, served with a choice of toppings, including real gravy. Enough of theory: I took myself the next day for a late, by Kauai standards, dinner to Number One.

The food is very bland. A local had raved about the tortilla soup, and it was all right. But very much on the bean-y side. I like mine more brothy. If you like beany tortilla soup, then maybe you'll like this place. I ordered the Salmon and Penne and it was so bland. I usually never put salt on my dinner, but this time I did and I had put a lot, mind you. The service was great and courteous. The atmosphere had nothing to complain about - nor to rave about. I just felt really bad that the food was tasteless. I had a good time regardless because I was with my fiancee. He didn't like his food nor his Syrah either.
The original Sals was excellent food. Both my husband and I have noticed a huge decline in the quality of food with the new owners. The cheese and sause used on the burgers is so horrible it actually smells and tastes like vomit. We thought it was an isolated incident-tried another location-and found the exact same experience. The hamburger patty was so scimpy, and to try to hide this fact-they added a ton of toppings and that horrible cheese. The prices have raised dramatically. We will never return to another sals.
Easily the worst seafood experience I had in the Maritime Provinces, perhaps the worst ever. Unfortunately, Billy's Seafood Company was mentioned in most of the travel guides I read. My meal was overpriced and overcooked. We had tried to get a table before a comedy act the night before, but they were very busy, so we stopped after a trip up the coast...I truly wish we hadn't. The hyper waiter couldn't answer a simple question... what do you have for beer??..so we ended up with run of the mill pisswater beer. I'm not sure they served anything better. I ordered the Deep Sea platter and was looking forward to a fine meal, instead I got mostly french fries that were so overcooked as to be inedible, clams that were anything but "juicy" as advertised, and haddock fried inches away from incineration. It was evident to me that the fryolator oil was past its sell by date, it's too bad the cook didn't notice. The only redeeming feature of the meal was the Digby scallops which must have been cooked separately...they were quite nice. My companion's meal, while digestible, was a disappointment. She found that the garlic in her seafood dish so overpowered the lobster, it might as well have been pollock. I am from the New England seacoast and my meal would have been a hanging offense at home. Really, fried clams shouldn't snap like potato chips! I know now that I should have complained, instead of gamely trying to find something good about the meal...it doesn't always pay to be as polite as Canadians. The irony is that the evening before we had a perfectly nice meal, complete with scallops and microbrewed beer at Tapps, a brewpub a block away. We spent a 3rd of the price of Billy's Seafood and actually enjoyed our meal. And our feet touched the floor. What's with the chairs anyway, Billy?
My wife and I had reservations. It took over an hour to be seated. We were told the grill would be closed shortly after we were seated. My wife's food seemed rushed. Mine was so salty that the manager almost fell over when I insisted he taste it. We left the restaurant angry and disgusted. Unless you are a know food critic or a cherished regular don't expect to be treated respectfully.
Ouch-we went because it was part of the Lettuce Entertain chain but we would not go again. Good location for the downtown hotels but they clearly take advantage of tourists with the marginal service and ambiance that can be similar to a noisey college lunch room . The food was good but it was not outstanding. Our waitperson was slow and inattentive. Prices are in the moderate to high range. NOT ONE OF CHICAGO'S BEST BETS!
I have to agree with the previous reviewer. Food was not very good. I ordered a pasta with red sauce. Sauce was terrible. They only had red pepper in it as a spice. No basil. No oregeno. I was also not happy that the server seemed to indicate the soup/salad came with the entree. Service was marginal. My companion's meal had to be returned as it was cold. It also took forever to take our order and then get our food. In terms of ambience, do not bring a date there. Difficult to carry on a conversation because of the noise. It is definitely not worth spending your money. I would suggest you dine elsewhere for the prices you pay! It is just not worth it!
I fondly remember the times in my childhood during the 60's and the 70's when my paternal grandparents, my parents,my sister and myself would pile into grandpa's Ford Maverick or mom's Chevy Impala,headed for the HoJo's in Milford,Ct,just off the Merritt Parkway. Naturally,we always went on Wednesday or Friday for the All-You-Can-Eat fish or clam fry. I remember being yelled at by my parents for using up all of the tartar sauce or for slurping my soda.I remember my teen-age sister expressing her embarrassment when my father ordered 3 or 4 plates of food.Those were the days! HoJo's were everywhere! Today this is the only surviving Howard Johnson's in the entire state of Connecticut. On the day after Christmas we were out shopping and were passing near this restaurant and,since it was lunch time,we decided to stop by for old times sake.Sadly,the old saying about not being able to re-live the past is true.The clams, fish ,coleslaw and fries were pretty much as we had remembered. What really used to set HoJo's apart,however, was the cheerful and attentive service that they provided. Patrons used to be presented with a basket of assorted warm rolls and butter as soon as their food was ordered.(This was actually HoJo's attempt to get you to fill up on bread!)The great service and the rolls are both no more! We nearly had to launch a flare when we wanted re-orders of clams and fish and when the re-orders came they were tiny. When we asked for larger re-orders the manager griped at our waitress and we then didn't get ANY re-orders until we reminded our waitress. The patrons next to us ordered omelets and had to re-order 25 minutes later as the manager threw out their order slip by mistake!Even the trio of youths in Gothic attire got poor service! I overheard the girl dressed up like Marilyn Manson say "My potato is hard".The three of them ended up playing a game of "hot potato" with it,except that the potato obviously wasn't very hot!It's sad what has become of this American Icon,but with the fast food generation comes the end of the old ways!
If you decide to eat here, do so only if you can sit in the ground floor room -- the tiny rooms downstairs are very cramped and very, very smokey if anyone is smoking. There are so many better places, so why bother?
Run-of-the-mill American restaurant; Americana decor, pub-like ambiance with black and white checkered tablecloths. We were started with Sourdough bread and whipped butter  sad to say this was the highlight of our experience. Everything went downhill from here. For appetizers we were intrigued by the Buffalo Shrimp ($7.99). What a waste of seafood! For entrees, I had the Hawaiian Chicken and Shrimp Salad with Coconut Mango Dressing ($10.99). The dressing- the coconut overpowered the mango; the pineapple was clearly out of a can and the chicken strips from the Perdue package or the deli section of the grocery. The greens were even worse! Not one ingredient in this salad was fresh! Hubby had a Bacon Cheddar burger ($6.99) it was decent, charbroiled (can't go wrong with that) and a nice size. Big disappointment in general, though no surprise. Other items that sounded appetizing: the Kalamata Pesto Bruschetta ($6.99). I guess we'll never find out if this is good or not.
Probably the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant. It all seemed wrong before we even sat down. Negotiating an obstacle course of coat-racks and a piano to get to my seat set the mood. The room is painted in an unusually ugly colour scheme which keeps your focus. Never mind. How's the food ? The starter was a boring slice of smoked salmon with no effort at all to even enhance it's presentation. The rib-eye beef reminded me of 25 years ago eating cardboard flavoured army stew from a tin can. Dessert was white. I am not sure what it was, just to say it was white. The prices were exorbitant and the atmosphere was pallid. The waitress even chased our party down the street afterwards to correct a minor error on the bill. I actually cannot say anything good about this place. Incredibly they had the audactity to put framed quotes and comments from positive newspaper reviews in the toilets. They must have been very selective choosing words carefully for highlighting. Sorry Fado. How you are in business is hard to fathom. I won't be back.
This place states it is family friendly, it was anything but. We were there new years for a nice dinner which ended up a disaster due to the loud music from the bar down stairs
It is hard to say what was the worst part of my lunching experience at Luna Park last Saturday (July 12 2003). Was it the fact that our waiter appeared to have the IQ of the mouse that so freely run around this place, or was it the fact that after waiting 55 minutes for a chicken wrap and omelette that the same docile waiter (having finally come out of hiding, where he had been to avoid our enquiring eyes) slouched over to us and informed us that the kitchen had burned the omelette and had to start again. All the while my lunch companion and I looked around for camera's, thinking that this had to be a wind-up. A further 10 minutes later, he returned with a mediocre omelette (after an hour one would expect something exceptional afterall) and one very cold chicken wrap. Honestly, what self respecting, omelette burning chef would send out a meal that had sat for an hour, without even challenging himself to heat it up, I don't know. Do you? To add insult to injury, Luna Park had the nerve and inexperience to charge us, I nearly fell off my chair, thereby joining the rampant mice having free reign on the floor. Needless to say, I would firmly recomment NEVER attempting to eat here. It was the second time and the last I will visit this dirty, over rated place and I advise you to do the same.
Another one of the tri-city area's fancy restaurants. In a big city, this would be just another restaurant, but it does really well for it's location and it's a pleasant change from fast food that dominates this market.
A little seasonal shop located across from Eureka Middle School. They do mostly ice cream, but have a pretty good selection of sandwhiches. The prices are pretty good....sandwhich, fries, and a pop for under $5.00, but I left hungry. A nice place that's quick that's not fast food in Eureka.
A while back we did a review of this restaurant's lunch buffet in which we described how tough and stringy the cuts of meat that they used in their dishes were. In that same review we mentioned how delicious of a meal that we had been served here at their dinner buffet back in November of 2003.When we recently tried their dinner buffet again we, unfortunately, found that they are now using the same tough, stringy meats in it! While some of the buffet choices were fairly decent, the poor quality of meats used in most of their dishes certainly took away from the experience. Hopefully they upgrade their ingredients soon!
Its a hotel restaurant so I guess I shouldn't have expected to much to begin with, the food was ok I mean not horrible, but the tall skinny guy with the attitude topped the cake.
I'd never been to a Red Robin before and one has just opened near where I live. I went online at work to view the menu, and order a take-away on my way home. Their website is good and the entrees are varied and described well. The only thing is I noticed the prices are not displayed on the site. I ordered the Ensenada Chicken Platter, the Crunchy Buffalo Style Shrimp, and the Hot Apple Crisp. I phoned in my order 20 minutes prior to my arrival. When I picked up my order it was ready to go. The total for the fore mentioned meal was $26. The Chicken Ensenada consisted of a dry chicken breast cut in half, they made up for the small amount of chicken with a huge helping of salad. Next was the Buffalo Shrimp. As I ate them I had a vision of a short order cook opening a box of Mrs. Pauls finest as they were no more "Crunchy" or "Buffalo'ed" than that. The Apple Crisp was ok. Although I didnt dine at Red Robin itself, its appearance was very weird. It was like going into a Johnny Rockets and finding a fully stocked bar attached to its side. An odd mix of family, fun food, teens, and hard liquor. I dont expect I'll be back due to the mediocre food and inflated prices.
Open air casual restaurant specializing in seafood. Good fish with basic blackened/broiled or fried preparations. There a some daily chef's specialties to round out the menu.
The Pepper Mill in Las Vegas is on one side a diner on the other side a loung. The diner part has some pretty good food, but I'll agree with the above, the service really sucks there and the waitresses aren't all that nice all the time. The lounge part is very comfortable and totally worth going to. It has a recessed seating area with a fire pit in the middle of water. They also have music videos going now.
My friend as well as the customer that sat next to us returned their food. Mine was o.k. The noodles taste weird and so do the sauces that they use. A lot of people eat there though. I fail to understand why. I have already given it a couple of chances.
The Cobalt Tavern is formerly known as the Washington Square Bar & Grill... we had a less than pleasant dining experience there recently. Slow service, I had to ask for water refills, no substitutions for vegetables...we're down on this place.
Parts of our orders were forgotten and some orders were completely wrong! The food was disgusting as well, tasting like canned food with too much salt! Our waiter also acted as if he were high on something. We received no refills on our drinks either. Taco Bell does a better impression of "mexican" food than this place.
too expensive to be not so good...
Ever since Il Sole re-opened I have been dying to go in and for what I thought relive the experience of true Italian dining again. We were so disappointed to see what Il Sole has become ever since they opened . Not only is the food not even good but no one even recognized us. Il Sole has lost it's charm and things just don't feel the same. It's a true shame ............
Good service but food was not so great. If you ask me, I prefer better food for the price.
We ordered two medium pizzas and soft drinks. The Pizza was one of the best that I have had in awhile.... but $55 for two pizzas seems a bit expensive.
In an area dominated with national chains, this is a good bet for lunch. Chips and salsa are always replenished. Many lunch specials are offered as well as a unique Mexican menu. It is located in a building that was once another resturant (we were thinking a Denny's). Don't miss the chicken vegatable soup.
The waitress was so rude and kept coming back to confront me when I told her to go away because she was upsetting me. It is a self-service place so all she had to do was come and pick up and place and did not require to have any conversation. I was the one that told her not to talk to me. So what did she do? She kept stopping members of my parties to complaint about me. It was awful. In the end, I didn't walk around because she kept trying to corner me and looking at me with angry eyes. Todai shouldn't hire rude employees. The food was alright but really overpriced. The place was really dirty and the tables were sticky. Horrible. Didn't enjoy that experience at all. WE had a birthday person there and they gave us a free meal for the next visit, because the waitress made it so horrible for us, we threw it away and didn't even think we should have pass the free meal to someone else.
WHAT A DISASTER! This place has gone downhill BIGTIME! I heard the original owner sold it so that explains it. Anyway the place is SO loud you cant even talk, also smells like clorine. The service was the worst, slow and slower. The food is your typical south-of-the-border cook playing chef (lots of cheese & oil!). More like fast-food. The new owner, Steve, what a creep! Bad breath and all, stayed at our table hitting on my girlfriend, telling us that Scott Baio is his partner & get this, his "best friend". We all agreed later that none of us have had a "best friend" since high school. GROW UP & RINSE YOUR MOUTH OUT WITH SCOPE! Obviously an overall BAD exprience. No wonder we were the only gals in the place on a Sat nt, the owner scares the others away.
It is a place that I thought would serve a better grade of food than it did. This is below pedestrian, and I think it is capable of much better than that.
A party of two, we enter the restaurant and the hostes (Miss Asian w/ no personality) is just looking at us as if we wanted to just stand in the middle of the foyer/ entrance to look good. Ignores us for a good few minutes until I walk to cashiers and request seating. We are escorted to a table witnout a pleasant smile nor a thank you. We politely smile and sit. A waiter (Male Asian, no personality either/ like most of the waiters there) come to ask for our order, He gets edgy when we inguire about the roasted duck serving and answers as if annoyed by three simple questions concerning food. Then he rushes the order, left, and did not give us a chance to order drinks until half way thru meal, Upset I informed him politely that he never waited for our drink order, Annoyed he doen't even apologize and brings the drinks and slams them on the table and rudely pushes the napking that my partner was using on the floor to place a can of soda. VERY RUDE, my motto is and I am sure it doesn't take a psychologist to realize that when one is served anywhere impolitely, one does not enjoy the service. We returned to our hotel, sick to our stomachs and upset at the horrible treatment. But, pay back is cruel, the prices are comfortable, but, he only received a $2 tip so he could see and realize his service was below poor. Its amazing how the homeless gentlemen down the street greeted us for not contributing than paying for a service and been treated rudely.
Had been there by myself on a previous trip, so this time I took my family. Service was the worst thing and the price was a little pricey. The buffalo wings were great because they had some size to them unlike most restuarants.
We usually go to another sushi restaurant close by but we got off to a late start and we were told Osaka stays open pretty late, well actually it says 24 hrs on the side of the building somewhere but really it stays open until 2 am. Okay, so we walk in, there seems to be a few of regulars seated at the sushi bar, quite loud and sauced I might add. We sit at the sushi bar and the first thing I notice is instead of warm washcloths we have sealed packets containing what appears to be oversized wet naps. Strike one, but whatever, it's like 11 pm at night I am hungry for sushi. it takes forever for the waitress to take our drink order. We receive our little wooden sushi geta tray with VERY pale, practically white, gari (pickled ginger) and very pale wasabi (a spicy Japanese root). This stuff looks like it sat in the sun too long and got bleached or was old. I lie to myself, thinking *maybe I am accustomed to westernized sushi with bright or pale pink gari and bright green wasabi*. "Maybe this is truly authentic" I think as I tried to justify it all. Who am I to judge, I am as Caucasian as they come. Strike two but I am still famished and I brush it off. They give us a little freebie appetizer salad, which I am accustomed to either getting edamame (soybeans) or seaweed salad, this salad consisted of a smidgen of immitation crab meat and cucumbers - cheap. Strike 3, but no out as I am starving by now. I order half an order of unagi roll (bbq eel roll), edamame (soybeans in their pods) with herb salt, and chuka salad (7 seaweed salad), oh and baked green mussels. Plus I ordered a half carafe of Pearl unfiltered sake, which I love! This is a plus. My boyfriend ordered the spider roll which is a tempura softshell crab roll. Pretty yummy usually. The people at the end of the bar are so drunk and loud it is amazing, I want to scream shut up for Buddha's sake! They were arguing with the waitress about their order saying they only had one or two beers each. They were clearly drunk. Out comes our food! The edamame was okay, what did I expect, it's soybeans. The sake was great but it is bottled sake so you have to try really hard to screw that up. The unagi roll was very thin on the eel, not really warm by the time it got to us either. The seaweed salad had more cucumbers in it than seaweed (cheap filler, I guess), the green mussels did not have QP mayo and masago on it as usual so I asked for mayo which I added, it was edible. The spider roll had barely any softshell crab in it and the crab it did have was dry, empty and surrounded my lots of batter. Plus the roll itself wasn't all that. I ate a bit of the crab out of the roll and left the rice and seaweed and accompaniments, my boyfriend ate no more after his first bite. That did it for us. Then of course more loud regulars who were quite sauced pour in and then I downed my sake and left before their loud voices gave me a headache. What a bummer this experience was because I really love sushi and I can't really afford to eat it all the time so I have to wait about another month before I can go have some real sushi. I will never go to Osaka in Henderson again. It just really was a poor experience all around. Next I will try Inaka Sushi which has all you can eat (should I even try??) - and if that doesn't work, back to my favorite restaurant - I Love Sushi in Henderson.
This is the dirtiest place i have ever set foot into. You could not pay me enough to eat here again! The food was gross, the servers were rude! Just plain right nasty!
This a cold, sterile-like restaurant with extremely poor service. Drinks are $9.00 each. Food is less than average. The restaurant is generally quite empty; therefore we thought we would receive good service...we didn't. Stay away!!!
Local chain in the Denver area. This location proveds a great breakfast opportunitty for travelers going to or from the airport. Basic brekfast menu but the skillets are the way to go. You can order them as listed or make any subs. you would like.
"The atmosphere here is eclectic.. it's a bar/lounge/sushi restaurant with a sushi bar up front and a huge back area with live music and video games. PROBABLY great for after-work cocktails and beers (they have a few Japanese beers- not easy to find in the Mission District.) However, their sushi is disappointing. Perhaps it's the incredible use of the 'shiso' leaf (beefsteak plant, that's what the dictionary says) which, although pleasant at times, can be an overpowering experience... The spicy tuna, spider roll, both included shiso leaves which we picked out as if we were doing a biology experiment. Service was pretty bad- our order took FORTY MINUTES, with NO attention from the waitstaff in between! Prices aren't that much lower than that in downtown SF, and Hana-zen or Sushi Groove do sushi much much better, and at comparable prices. Also, Yo's does not have rainbow rolls. Or, if you're in the Mission and dying for sushi, you might want to check out that place on Cortland in Bernal Heights, only a few minutes walk away. "
The food was good & the waitress was nice as could be with the crowd she had. I ate at golden corral Plainfield Indiana and after dinner, I went to the restroom and would have preferred an outhouse. The bathrooms were not clean enough to enter. I have emailed the restaurant in Plainfield with no response and it has been over 2 weeks. I guess cleanliness don't count for any thing these days. As far as I am concerned, I won't eat at this restaurant again. The waitress was made aware of the mess and she had told us she made the manager aware of this. this is the reason for the overall rating of 1.
I love this restaurant. The food reminds me of a French bistro. I recommend it to all.
Upon entering ZaZou, you will wait approximately 15 minutes before you are acknowledged. Once you sit you will be approached by a server that has absolutely no idea what they are doing. The food has absolutely no flavor. I ordered a Filet Mignon, very rare. I had to send it back 3 times. The first time they brought me the wrong entree, the second time the right entree was prepared well done and the third time it was prepared medium well. I ended up not eating at all with no apologies being made. I suggest they hire a knowledgeable waitstaff and replace their so called CEC.
Right off the Interstate and one of only two restuarant's in Ashkum. Good traditional food....this place is really good for breakfast.
The food was very good! It is some of the best Asian food I've ever eaten. I was disappointed because the service was very little. Also, the restaurant adds a 15% tax to the bill automatically. For the service give, 15% is even too high!!
Nice little bar and grill located in the Metro Center. They only serve food up until 9:00 which sucks for the late night crowd. The food is pretty good. They brag about a Jim Beam battered chicken breast.....eh...not bad, but I've had better. I love the bar though. If they served food later, I would probably eat there more often. As a dinner spot, not bad, but there's better close by.
Whille food was good, extremely slow to get food on the table and even slower to present the check. Have eaten here at other times with fewer people and service is always slow.
Place was nice did not care for the BBQ or the service. Don't forget to bring your own beer.
With a reservation we waited well over an hour to be seated and then were treated rudely by both management and staff. They were overbooked and under staffed. The only thing about this place that is five star are the prices.
Yam Yam's should be listed as takeout only! We had to seat ourselves, take our own orders, pour our own drinks and correct a order mix-up through marathon negotiations. Outside of that the food was by far the best Soul Food around. Yam Yam's prides themselves on the barbecue they serve, getting many write-ups and accolades. We never tried the barbecue since there was no one taking orders to recommend their specialty so we may never know how good the barbeque was. We tried the seafood basket with shrimps, oysters and catfish including a side of Mac and Cheese and Red Rice, however, if in the future I were to visit Yam Yam's again it would only be for takeout.
The only reason I would recommend going to this restaurant is the food. The owner is a disgruntled Sicilian who always seems like he is giving you attitude. However, he makes the most incredible pizza and calzones I have ever had in my life. It's a bit costly (so bring a coupon), but well worth it. I go out of my way to get to this place when I am traveling through the area.
Probably one of my most unusual and unpleasant lunch experiences. We ordered iced tea for drinks and they were served in very small highball type glasses with more ice than tea. So during the course of the meal we had to ask for more tea. I should have known something was up when we got new glasses each time. When the bill came our iced tea chargel alone was $7.50. We were charged $1.50 for each glass of tea. When I asked the waitress about the unreasonable drink bill, she informed us that there are no refills on drinks. I asked why she had not informed us of that and here curt response was "It's in the menu"! I asked to see the menu and yes it did say that, but in very small print well below the drink section of the menu. I put the bill on my charge and did not leave a tip. When we were just outside the front door, this waitress charged out and wanted to know where her tip was. I told her that the bartender had it in the form of an outrageous drink bill. She then went back inside and slammed the door. I was not going to say anything about the bill, but after that experience I sought out the owner. He explained the drink policy, but just blew me off about the conduct of the waitress. Needless to say on subsequent visits to beautiful Door County, we have avoided this unfriendly place.
A quick service resturant that offers wrapps, rice bowls, and salads. There are many combinatations and offers to choose from. A great healthy alturnative to fast food.
Very pleasantly surprised by the food. I had low expectations, but the wings turned out to be very, very good. Love the greasy chicago-style fries they serve as well.
Nothing special. Seemed really expensive for what it was. Basically a sandwhich place that specializes in Greek food. They also sell the usual American sandwhiches. ie. Hot Dogs, Italian Beef, Hamburgers, etc. The place is a little building located a couple blocks from Illinois State University. If your looking for Greek food, here ya go. If your looking for sandwiches, find something else...it may be cheaper.
The service was slow and the wait staff seemed like when asked for something (like, more water, breadsticks, etc..) we were bugging them or putting them out. The food was bland and the portions small for the price! I will NEVER return!
A little hot dog shop which is mainly a carry-out place. Food ain't bad neither is the price. Good Italian Beef. Hot dogs are just ok.
Small portions and very overpriced for the area.
These people should change to another industry. They are inhospitable and rude
You can decorate a high school gymnasium for the junior prom with all the balloons and crepe paper you can find, but underneath it all it still looks pretty much like a gym. The same holds true with Mecca, which was carved out of a vast empty space on the ground level of a condominium complex. Ornate floral arrangements crowd the entrance, heavy velvet draperies separate the dining room from the bar, and tables are covered with starched white cloths and candles, but the concrete floors and walls and exposed pipes and air conditioning ducts overhead make this place feel more like a warehouse than the old-time supper club it aspires to be. In a city where outstanding restaurants proliferate, I don't quite understand either the appeal or success of Mecca. Its clientele consists mostly of chic 20 and 30-somethings with lots of disposable income, who appear to be there more to be seen than to enjoy a decent meal. Dressed to the nines, they pose at the circular bar three deep, shouting at each other in a vain attempt to be heard above the criminally loud sound system. Mecca may yearn to be a supper club, but it moves to the beat of a disco. Apparently the owners have lost sight of the fact that in all those 1940s "Thin Man" films, William Powell and Myrna Loy never tossed off clever quips while a DJ spun records in the background. I mention disposable income because dining here requires it. This is not a place for young marrieds with a babysitter watching the kids, or an older couple on a fixed income. The prices here are steep; with cocktails and wine added to the cost of an entree, one could easily pay in excess of $100 for dinner here - and walk out hungry. Mecca is one of those restaurants where you see more plate than food when your meal is placed before you. As a starter, warm crab salad ($13.75) sounded like a good idea, but it was swimming in a hollandaise sauce so heavily flavored with vanilla that it tasted more like a dessert course. Pan-roasted scallops with black trumpet mushrooms and fava bean puree were more successful, but at $11.50 there should have been more than two tiny scallops in the serving. A small portion of roast chicken ($14.75) had skin the color of ebony; the meat was dry and the sauce tasted burnt. The couscous with raisins on which it rested had soaked up much of the sauce and therefore had no distinctive flavor of its own. Seared ahi tuna ($21.50) was nearly raw; we requested it be cooked a little more, and when it returned it was overdone and tasteless. Service, at our table at least, was indifferent. Our waiter was too busy flirting with the party of four young men at the next table to pay us much attention. We waited forever for our appetizers, and had just started them when our main courses were thrust upon us. The waiter placed all blame on the kitchen, but clearly the fault was his. Our plates were finally removed long after we finished our meal, and there was another long wait before we could ask for and then finally get our check. When we expressed our dissatisfaction with the meal, the waiter stared back in silence. Our comments to the maitre d' elicited the response that hopefully next time things would be better. What made him think we'd consider a next time when nobody cared that this time was a disaster? Valet parking adds to the notion that you're eating in an upscale restaurant, but in this neighborhood, where finding a spot within reasonable walking distance could take an hour or so, it's practically mandatory. Ironically, just around the corner is Chow, which I have reviewed previously and which surpasses Mecca in every way imaginable, at a mere fraction of the cost. Spare yourself some aggravation and eat there instead.
This restaurant use to be one of the best places to go for a romantic dinner but the menu has doubled in price, the quantity has slid down the portions are not up to par. You pay way too much for the lobster for what you get, they call a half a lobster tail 4 lbs when it should say 2lbs and Steak for $32.00 and you get 2 small bites out of the lobster, The service is not anything like they use to have.
We vacation for a week in Lancaster County,Pennsylvania every fall. We had always wanted to try the legendary Shady Maple Smorgasbord, but had not up until this year as it is a little bit out of our way. We didn't miss much!They have a large variety of foods, but almost everything on the smorgasbord was very bland. Most of the food was of the frozen or pre-cooked type, not what one would expect from a restaurant in the Pennsylvania Dutch country!The "gentleman" serving the supposed "prime rib" was very rude to my wife and the "prime rib" was obviously derived from an old dairy cow!
If you enjoy cramming into a loud, abrasive, pretentious environment, and I mean loud, then head on down to Bin. To enjoy the added annoyance of constant cell phones then you should try their newest store, the creatively named Bin 942. The menu appears to be good value until you discover the meager portions. The tapas restaurant competition is too fierce to slack and that is what Bin does.
Found hair twice in my entree. management was unresponsive to my concern and made no attempt to remedy the incident. In fact, upon lodging my complaint, the manager "short-changed" me when I paid the check!!
This is not the first currascaria that I have been to. Meat was greasy. Smoke flavoring tasted as if it was liguid smoke. Service was terrible. Setting not very, seemed dirty. I would never return!
