5	pos	dev	The Fireside Cafe has wonderful homestyle cooking, great service and a very home like atmosphere.
5	pos	dev	Upscale food and service with a relaxed atmosphere. Wonderful view of the lake front, if you need a hotel the accommodations at Manteo are wonderful.
5	pos	dev	******Excellent Everything**** We highly recommend this establishment. We will be back!!
5	pos	dev	"I can see why La Tour has quickly gained the reputation of being ""where the chefs go to eat."" The food quality is excellent and complimented by an excellent wine list (a Wine Spectator Award Winning list). The interior decor is warm and contemporary. We had an excellent overall dining experience at La Tour and it has quickly become our favorite restaurant in Vail. No wonder it was voted ""Best French Restaurant in Vail Valley"", Best Food - Regardless of Price"" and ""Most Amazing Restaurant Service"" by the Vail Daily reader's poll."
5	pos	dev	Very pleasant atmosphere. Made to feel very welcome without being imposed upon by waitress.
5	pos	dev	I've been to Mallorca many times and have always had a pleasant experience. Food is wonderful, wait staff is attentive, prices are reasonable. One of my favorite restaurants.
5	pos	dev	Beautiful restored victorian inn...amazing food, organic, local, seasonal.. The oysters were to die for! The staff friendly and accomodating. They recomended a great place for breakfast and a hike! Don't miss this place what a find!
5	pos	dev	On the high-end restaurants, this one ranks well. The service was impeccable and swift, the food was delicious. When I ordered a Cafe Diablo that was less than expected, it was replaced with another coffee with no problem. The prices are a little steep and the lighting could use a nudge (ambiance does not mean inability to see your food), but overall was a pleasant dining experience.
5	pos	dev	Well worth the free ferry ride from Hatteras. Great sandwiches with an ample amount very good fries. The waiter was excellent and the atmosphere was very nice, very open and lots of neat stuff on the walls.
5	pos	dev	"If you want great pizza this is the place to go in Texas as far as I'm concerned. I eat pizza often I am from Philly and rarely does one find this high quality pizza ANYWHERE let alone in Texas. The crust is light and flavorful and Hand tossed. Mama's has great sauce that doesn't leave you with heartburn and they use four cheeses on their pizzas. No corners are cut here. The menu includes some very tasty ""white"" pizzas including a Margherita and a Pesto pizza using fresh balsi leaves that is out of this world. Their salads are very cheap and very good. They use a mix of lettuces and greens. ALSO... THEY HAVE CALZONE AND STROMBOLI!!! In addition, Mama's often has live jazz on the deck out back in the middle of the week. If you are on the Texas Gulf Coast and want amazing pizza make the trip to Mama's. You won't be disappointed."
5	pos	dev	Dining at Yoder's provided me with an experience unlike any other. The staff made an effort to provide the costumers with the utmost satisfaction. I believe that the pancakes have given me new life and have actually cleared up my acne. I don't have to purchase medication anymore. Also try their hot chocolate, it's divine
5	pos	dev	This restaurant was one of the best I've ever been to. The food was fantastic! My compliments to the chef. The atmosphere was relaxing and the chef was very entertaining. It was a dining experience that I've been raving about ever since and I can't wait to go back.
5	pos	dev	Great Atmosphere, welcomong staff, and a menu that should have a table of contents! Wow! Everyone--even the most particular--should find something to excite them. And perhaps an idea that should be widespread, offering a choice of soup/salad or desert--very attractive option. We enjoyed excellent salmon served over ravioli with a parmesan sauce and gnochi with a pistachio sauce. Server--Ben--was a prince and the bill was a pleasant surprise.
5	pos	dev	Food is the best!!! Run by family, you feel right at home. Not your average chain rest. First class all the way. Casual attire is the norm. Make reservations on busy evening (Fri. & Sat)
5	pos	dev	This or Carrabba's is my favorite restaurant, depending on mood I guess. The first time we ate there it was my family of five and my sister, her husband, and his mother was visiting from N. Ireland. The food and service are both just absolutly superb. The price is a little bit on the high side, but this is understandable. The reason I give the atmosphere a 4 is because they do allow smoking. My son has asthema and we try to get a table as far away from smoking as possible. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this place and do and will return frequently.
5	pos	dev	The food is excellent, the service is excellent, the pies are to die for, and the prices are reasonable. The Waitress was very helpful. I would definitely go back here to dine again!
5	pos	dev	Don and Mary (the owners) have it NAILED. The restaurant is smaller and more intimate, perfect for that romantic night out! The menu is a wonderful blend of italian favorites (Veal or Chicken picata, marsala,etc, and a great red sauce!) and subtle yet delicious twists of classic dishes (Veal Angelina or Vintners Chicken). A variety of fresh fish is also prepared daily and you must try the Cioppino! But, save room for Mary's home made desserts (she really makes them at home!) such as her cobblers or my favorite Sticky Irish Toffee Cake. Prices are very reasonable, the wine cellar is unique and the service is GREAT! Make reservations on Friday or Saturday nights, tho! Open Tues. - Sat. Once you go, you'll be back!
5	pos	dev	great food service and atmosphere eat there at least twice a month
5	pos	dev	Incredible people with incredible menu. We enjoyed our steaks and seafood, as well as the help of the owner who showed my son how to eat crab legs. I think her name was Ms. Daniels..... Small town should be proud of this wonderful establishment. The prices were cheap, the food was great, and service and atmosphere was the best I've seen!
5	pos	dev	Chef Jean-Claude makes incredible gourmet dishes. Nice attmosphere and location. Worth the trip to the Sierra Foothills.
5	pos	dev	"My g/f and i have eaten here many times. We usually only go whenever they have ""buy one get one entree free"" coupons in the monthly Clipper since we really can't afford to spend ~$80(including tip) on a normal dinner date. I LOVE the food. i cant handle anything too spicy but i love cajun food(go figure!) so the fact that nothing here is obnoxiously spicy is perfect for me. the chef(s) are the best cajun specialists in this region. they add just the right amount of spice to everything and it's always cooked perfectly. the wait for the food is never too long. the timing of the appetizers/salads/main course is always nicely spaced out. not too quick or slow. the last time we were there, our waiter took an oddly long time to first take our order or refill our water. the service is usually better than that though since the staf is always friendly and personable. maybe they were having a rough day or something. i also love the small and intimate atmosphere. luckily we havent had to share the space w/ a rowdy party...but then this really isnt the type of place to attract that type of crowd. overall, i love the place and it's really a unique place to dine in this region as far as food is concerned."
5	pos	dev	"I have been eating at this wonderful resturant since we moved to this area 16 years ago. We would not order pizza from any other place, but Riccardos is so much more than a ""pizza"" place. The owner and chef Vito always ask after the family and the food he prepares is delicious, wholly satisfiying and filling. He also is always changing and updating both the food and atmosphere. My family and I will continue to patronize this fine establishment!"
5	pos	dev	I cannot believe this place could get a bad review. The bar is world class. The service excellent and the food superb. It was a business dinner, we were not rushed and I will definitely return for a romantic event. Well done Bravo
5	pos	dev	Wonderful, Authentic Japanese food. We sat at the Sushi Bar, and ordered the 'Dinner in a Box' (you can see a picture of it on their website www.sushiomaha.com) Would recommend this restaurant if you're ever in Omaha.
5	pos	dev	Yes I must say this is the best kept secret in Hell's Kitchen. Most of my friends have told me to try it out and so we went with a group and it was the best in the area. I realy think its true what the peaple say that this restaurant is a well kept secret. I enjoy going to this restaurant and they treat me like as if I am in my own home. I think I will keep going to Meson Sevilla years to come.
5	pos	dev	Norma's is a gem. The food is wonderul--in the front, she serves a la carte Lebanese food, which is fresh and delicious. The back room is for the 8 course Moroccan feast, where the diner is treated royally! There is even belly dancing on Fridays and Saturday nights. Go with a group, it's a blast.
5	pos	dev	A fine dining experience in my home town of PSL. This is one of our finer restaurants with a wide variety of dishes to choose from. We eat there on a regular basis normal wait is from 1-2 hours during season-extremely popular place. Mainly wood tones and forest green on one side is a beautiful bar and the other is dining. The wait staff is fantastic, and again the food is unbelievable.
5	pos	dev	I enjoyed my time at this restaurant and am looking forward to returning again and again. I have also recommended this restaurant to friends. The food is great, and the waitstaff are on the ball. Chef Vito was on hand adding his personal touch to the dining experience.
5	pos	dev	"It was time for my wife's Birthday/Valentine's present and so we take our annual trip to the Mai Kai. This present is the highlight of the ""Carmen Season"", that period between February 2nd and Valentine's Day. If it is romance you are looking for, this is the place for it. From the first moment you cross the plank bridge to the valet parking station, and enter the tiki guarded entrance, you enter a different world, Polynesia. There are so few places like the Mai Kai. It came to be in the mid 1950s when Trader Vics and other restaurants capitalized on the popularity of Polynesian food. For the first time, high speed air travel made the trip to the islands possible in a shorter time, but the cost was still prohibitive for the average working stiff. So the Polynesian restaurant, be it Vics or Ports of Call became a surrogate trip to the islands. The founder of the Mai Kai, Mireille Thornton was a local Polynesian woman who created her own little slice of paradise on what was then Ft. Lauderdale's busiest roadway. She carefully created a place that reflected the feeling of being in Hawaii or Tahiti, or any of the other Pacific Polynesian islands. There are waterfalls and a tropical garden and a ship themed bar. A night out at the Mai Kai is magical. Ms. Thornton has been very careful, from the start in 1956 until now, to maintain her vision for this place. She personally choreographs the show every year looking, as any good producer, for creative new ways to bring the Polynesian spirt of dance, music, and food to her guests. I say guests, because her customers become guests from the moment the attentive staff welcomes them. The first stop just inside the front door and a quick turn to the left is the Molokai Bar. The Molokai is like being in the stern lounge of a masted ship. Just outside the windows, the water is always falling. The rough hewn tables and booths offer a quiet place to have one of the Mai Kai's favorite drinks. One of the things I love about the Mai Kai is that many people, like me, don't like alcohol. It's okay with me if I'm the only one at the table drinking a non alcoholic beverage and the Mai Kai makes it better for the non drinker, they have a whole host of non alcoholic tropical drinks plus, anything from a Pina Colada to a Malayan Mist can be ordered alcohol free. The drink menu lists drinks as Mild, Medium, and Strong, so each person can decide his or her own capacity. When you move to your table, you'll find the same friendly, attentive service you found in the bar. This year, we began with the PuPu platter ($13.95) which includes Shanghai Chicken, Egg Roll, Crab Rangoon, and Tahitian Cheese Tangs. It comes on a Tiki God shaped warmer and is a delight for the eyes as well as the tastebuds. For our entrees this year, Carmen had her favorite, the Grilled Macadamia Nut Crusted Grouper served over a Vanilla Grand Marnier Sauce with a side of rice and tropical aioli. ($26.00) This to me is the star of the fresh fish menu and is a huge platter. I had the Filet Mignon, hand cut and lightly seasoned with a soy ginger brandy steak marinade roasted in their chinese wood oven and served with a bouquet of vegetables ($33.00) This is a mammoth cut of steak and enough to fill up the most ardent steak lover. Of course no meal is complete without dessert and we chose the Bananas Bengali ($12.50 for 2) which is vanilla ice cream topped with bananas which have been flambeed in a rum sauce. 12.50 for a flaming dessert is not a bad price for two people. As dessert begins, the famous Mai Kai Polynesian review also begins. With authentic Polynesian instruments and veteran dancers, this review rivals any this side of the islands. Your host, Sonny, guides you from island to island with explanations of each dance and what to watch for. The show's climax is the thrilling fire dance where two male dancers bring flaming torches to their bodies and twirl them so rapidly you believe there must be a trick, but it's no trick, it's years of doing the fire act until it is absolute precision. No visit to South Florida is complete without a stop at the Mai Kai and every resident within driving distance should go at least once a year for the new show. Sure it is a bit pricey, but worth it. If the cost scares you, there is a $45 per person fixed price dinner with show which includes your choice of select soup or salad, choice of five different entrees, and a dessert. This is a great deal. Just ask for the Bali Hi special. Although I am not a sushi eater, if you like sushi, take note. Wednesday nights from 5-9 PM, the Molokai bar features a free sushi buffet with the purchase of cocktails. Included in the sushi are Salmon, Tuna, Peking Duck Roll, Boxed salmon Sushi, Shrimp Sushi, California Roll, JB Roll, Beef Roll, and Tuna Roll. All of this free with the purchase of a cocktail. That cannot be beat. Go, you won't regret it."
5	pos	dev	The food was hot and served quickly. The servers wait until you get through most of the salad course before bringing out the hot food. If you need more of anything, they bring it quickly. Great experience.
5	pos	dev	At Mediterranean Kitchen, the key word is GARLIC. If you don't like garlic, or are allergic, STAY AWAY. If, however, you are, like so many of us, a garlic lover, this is the restaurant for you. You will be greeted by most likely the owner who is nothing less than the most gracious, considerate individual you will ever meet. His sincere gratitude for your attendance is overwhelmingly evident. The servers are polite, attentive and prompt. Simply the best. And the food will never fail to exceed your expectations. FIVE SMILES!
5	pos	dev	Superb! A great ambience exists in Joe Pena's. Large portions, friendly service and cheap but delicious cocktails combine to make this one of our favourite eateries in Frankfurt. Excellent for parties and birthday celebrations, the wine is also top-notch. The tequila is superb, the music even better and overall you will not be disappointed! It's prime location means it is not far from the delights of Bockenheim, the university and a particularly good bar/cafe called Cafe Extra Blatt.
5	pos	dev	"Thurman's has a great atmosphere! There is ""stuff"" all over the walls and ceiling. I see something new and different every time I visit. It is very small so the wait can get long on the weekends, but it is a great place to eat. The food is pretty decent and the prices are very low (2 people can eat and drink for under $25). The burgers are so big I have to take half of it home and the beer is always cold : )"
5	pos	dev	"This bar/restaurant is my favorite-ANYWHERE. I moved to Columbus in 1993 not knowing a soul and found the Thurman a couple blocks from my new apartment. Over the next 12 years, I got to know the whole staff very well--and even lived with one of the bartenders, Mr. Kevin Ryan, for 4 years on and off. What great service, a hometown Cheers atmosphere, and wonderful food and service. They make every effort to serve locals and tourists alike and their burgers are the best I have had anywhere, bar none. Special orders--no problem! Local color--they're the specialists. Come expecting the best and you'll receive it. I love my friends at Thurman Cafe and I miss it soooooooo much now that I've moved back ""down South"". Victor, Cesar, Kevin, Sharmin--you guys are the best and I love you all!"
5	pos	dev	Excellent restaurant. Great tasting food, wonderful decor and awsome service
5	pos	dev	Ashland is well-known for being inundated with top-notch restaurants but the Black Sheep is magical. The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is very unique. It feels like a british pub but the food is above and beyond fish and chips (although they do serve it and it is fantastic). I had the venison with juniper berry sauce and it was amazing. Quite an appropriate place to preamble a show at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
5	pos	dev	I wonderful place to eat. The service was quick and our server was very pleasant. We all had different entree's. Every entree was as ordered. I had the strip steak. It was delicious, and cooked the way I ordered it ...Rare. I will go back again and again. This was my first visit, and did not even know this was owned by Mike O'meara the radio personality.
5	pos	dev	Fabulous sandwichs. I was in Cambria for a week and ate lunch here every day. The Java smoothie is incredible. The staff is delightful. I will return.
5	pos	dev	The amount of food is amazing. You don't get this much food anywhere else...period! Not to mention how good it is! We'll definitely be back!
5	pos	dev	Grear restaurant authentic greek food just like grandmas cooking in the old country. Try the lamb dishes, they also have fresh fish daily. If you are adventurous try the broiled octopus. I highly reccomend Roditys where you get great food for the value of your dollar.
5	pos	dev	I have been a loyal fan of Ruen Pair, then with the new management, I became an even bigger fan. The atmosphere, service, and Food have greatly improved since then. Definately pleased with the new look and will be coming back for more.
5	pos	dev	Several friends and I have enjoyed this little gem on many occasions..they always make you feel like their most valued customer. We aways go when we're in New York.
5	pos	dev	Excellent restaurant all the way around. We've dined here while visiting the Ft. Myers area several years in a row now and it is always phenomenal! We've never been dissapointed!
5	pos	dev	"Scones to-die-for. Brunch at better-than-reasonable prices. Over 110 teas to choose from. Kick-back and whimsical. ""Charming"" would be a huge understatement."
5	pos	dev	Best food north of the Twin cities. We met chef kevin,hes great. Hes a very professional person. He answered all of are questions plus he is very funny in a good way.He is not cocky,he just knows he is good. Thanks Chef Kevin if you read this.
5	pos	dev	The atmosphere at Flounder's is very nice. There are many old beach pictures and memorbilia decorating the walls. The food was great (THE BREAD, THE BREAD WAS AWESOME!), and the service was good considering how busy the restaurant was. It was a very nice restaurant.
5	pos	dev	I have visited this steakhouse more than most. From 1979 to 1981, I ate there nearly 2 times per week after work. I've been going to the Northwestern Steakhouse since my parents brought me there in the late 1960's. I have been away from Mason City since 1981, however, when I visit, you can bet I'll be at the Northwestern Steakhouse one of the nights while I'm in town. This is a FANTASTIC place to eat and I would highly recommend going there to anyone even passing through town! This is the best steak house in the country; no lie!
5	pos	dev	A wonderful dinner. Chef Pierre greeted us at the door and even returned to our table later to help with our wine selection. The service was conscientious and responsive, the food was great (don't miss the lobster bisque), and the dessert menu is a great capper to the whole experience. Expect to spend more time & money on dinner than you may be used to, but the experience is worth it for a special occasion.
5	pos	dev	This is actually a butcher shop, but during the summer, they have a cook-out everyday for lunch. They serve the best BBQ pork chops, sausages, etc. that you'll ever have at a backyard BBQ
5	pos	dev	I like it! :)
5	pos	dev	After a very unpleasant experience at another local place this place renewed our faith in shore town restaurants. Everything was wonderful-the staff was knowledgeable about the whole menu and guided us through our selections with ease. The food dishes were as huge as they were delicious, (we brought home what we couldn't eat) and they are a very kid friendly place, We met the owner and told her of our bad experience ealier in the week and how we were thinking of just eating sandwiches the rest of the week but gave her place a try hoping it would be good. She told us unfortunatly we had picked a place that was known for it's sub par food and it's family fist-fights in front of it's customers-not every place was like that-just the one we had gone to a few days earlier-scarred me for life I tell ya-and to make up for us having such a bad experience at the other place she bought us a bottle of wine and also bought our desserts. What a classy place with a wonderful woman-Thanks Rosie!!. The Food was absolutely amazing from the rigatoni to the veal chops-(like butta!!) I have never had a veal chop so tender. The kids meals were wonderful too-they ate it all. The desserts were in a class all by themselves-they must have an in house pastry chef-amazing. Thank you for great food, great conversation and for renewing our trust in wildwood's italian eateries. Rosie even suggested some other good places but we cam back to Alfe's the rest of our vacation( four more times that week). Why ruin a good thing!!! We are going to try to get to the other places she suggested next year but I have a feeling we are going to see Rosie a few more times next year on our vacation!! If you are going to eat Italian while in Wildwood, stay away from the neon south beach colored place and make your way on down to Alfes-with or without the kids-it will be the mist pleasant place you eat on your whole vacation!!!!! And no kitchen guys beating up other kitchen guys-what a novel idea!!!!
5	pos	dev	Don't let the name fool you. This is not a fast food restaurant - it is a family restaurant with great food and huge portions. They have a very large menu, and allow you to create your own combination plates from a number of ala carte items. They also let you choose the sauce to accompany your meal - ranging from mild to very hot. This is also a very kid-friendly place.
5	pos	dev	A day time only, open air restaurant. Enclosed herb garden surrounded by roses and silver birch trees with a fountain in the centre to create an atmosphere of intimacy. Umbrellas to shade you from the heat of the South African sun. Food ranges from butternut soup to chicken bake (all served with a homemade health loaf) to curry scones with apricot jam and cheddar cheese! A peaceful, but idyllic experience... Had to stay until closing time!
5	pos	dev	This restaurant is obviously the next big thing in restaurant chains. I would call it the Outback of seafood restaurants. The shrimp and crab stuffed grouper was amazing, as was the coconut and macadamia encrusted mahi. The service was terrific, very knowledgeable about all products, and we would definitely return.
5	pos	dev	This is one of the finest Italian restaurants in Sonoma County, so if you're in Petaluma, you MUST stop there for lunch or dinner. I work in Petaluma and eat lunch there 1 to 2 times a week and have NEVER been disappointed. The food is outstanding and the waitstaff very friendly. It's a bit of a small place, so reservations can be a good thing, but not necessary. Try the bruschetta rustica...it's heavenly! The gnocchi is outstanding as are their salads and pastas. Great place to eat!!!! The restaurant is located in the Orchard Supply Hardware shopping center on N. Mc.Dowell Boulevard.
5	pos	dev	great
5	pos	dev	well as i walked in i was greated by the great staff that work there.then me and my family where seated . the meal was delicious. i had a stuffed shell meal and my wife had spaghetti. we both also had garlic knots with are meal.the outher two that where with us had chicken cheese steaks and fries.we all enjoyed are food very much ,but the atmosphere of nice friendly people made are dinner at Riccardo's Italian Eatery a great one.
5	pos	dev	The Valley Cafe is a nice small town homestyle restaurant. They will also deliver. They have a wide variety of various items including a buffet to choose from as well as beverages. They are always friendly to kids with fast courteous service. Good food good people good environment, long hours and open weekends.
5	pos	dev	The Latigo Kid, nestled in the Whizin's Shopping Center off the 101 between Kanan & Chesebro, is a hidden epicurian treasure. The Mexican food is unparalled in it's fresh, tender chicken, gooey, flavorful cheeses, tasty, mildly spicy salsa with onions & garlic and courteous service. My chip basket was never empty and my water glass was constantly full. The margaritas are excellent thanks to a very talented bartender named Carlos. The prices are right and the portions are large. An A+ experience all around.
5	pos	dev	The Star is a Basque restaurant located in Elko Nevada. Folks it doesn't get any better than this. The filet mignon top with garlic is my favorite. Try the filet and lobster combo if you want a real treat.
5	pos	dev	The best BBQ I have ever tasted anywhere, and that includes my Mom's!!!
5	pos	dev	If dining should be an experience then Tru is for you. It is an elegant experience where French cuisine meets Asian Fusion style. Don't skimp out, choose the Chef's Collection from the Prix Fixed menu, and you won't leave disappointed. Plan at least 3 hours for dinner, sit back and enjoy!
5	pos	dev	Great food, Very friendly atmosphere. Chef Joe and his family were very gracous and we enjoyed our 5th visit, Pleasantly suprised when we rec our bill. This was truly a great family restuant as everyone made us feel at home. It is nice to know that Papa Joe and his family cater at resonalbel prices too.
5	pos	dev	This is a delightful little Bistro specializing the French Mediterranean Gourmet & Healthy Cuisine. Many of the menu items are offered in smaller portions, including some of the wines. Although there was a large party the first time I went, the staff was very attentitive us as well. I've been there for dinner and lunch and highly recommend it. It is kind of expensive but well worth it
5	pos	dev	Ruth's Chris steakhouse is sooooooooo good. I always go there on New Year's Eve. I get the steak. It's the bomb! I don't normally like steak very much, but after I went there, I felt like I was in heaven.
5	pos	dev	Not to be confused with Goodfellas Pizzeria, this classy little restaurant is located in the west village, on the corner of Bleecker and Christopher. My all-time favorite restaurant, the owner Tony always makes you feel at home. The atmosphere is wonderfully cozy, the service is remarkable, and the food - there are no words to describe it... One word of warning however - don't fill up on the amazing focacia they place on your table when you arrive!
5	pos	dev	Sindicato Do Chopp has several locations around Rio. Two of the best are the one on Avenida Atlantica in Copacabana (because of the beach view and the fact that folks come in wearing beach wear), and the Ipanema loaction. At both the food is above average, the prices are great, and all locations have several TVs so on football days they resemble American Sports taverns. The steaks are great, during the week the Ipanema location has a buffet for lunch at about $4(US) a person. If you want to try Brazilian beer this a great place to do it. Chopp (pronounced show-peh) means draught beer and they have lots of it. Not to be missed by serious beer cultists or folks looking for a tavern atmosphere.
5	pos	dev	One of the most fantastic restaurants we've EVER been to. Highly recommended for any special occasion
5	pos	dev	Food was great, have not had a good real cantonese style meal in bay area for a long time. Place is new and clean. Services was good.
5	pos	dev	Excellent as always. Some of the best food in the area.
5	pos	dev	My experience was exceptional. Sushiya has a hip ambiance and the food was great! I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different. Sushiya also has a great D.J. and no staff member is less than good-looking!
5	pos	dev	TeaSpace is a small, wonderful space with an eclectic, artistic atmosphere. Since I discovered in December of 2000, I've been quite a few times. Tea is the focus, with dozens of varieties of hot tea and bubble teas, in addition to a limited selection of saki and beer. The menu isn't large, but the food is always delicious. Highlights for me have been the salmon and tofu satays, served with rice and sesame green beans. Be sure to ask about specials. I've had two, a marinated beef satay and a broiled salmon filet served with wasabi mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. Again, its a small space, so you might have to wait, but the wait is worth it. You can spend the time exploring the various art and art installations that line the walls and ceiling. Take a close look at some of the light fixtures and you'll find tiny printed messages. And enjoy the music, played late at night by various DJs. Teaspace is open seven days a week, beginning at 3pm, and staying late into the night.
5	pos	dev	Food was wonderful, buffet with over 180 items, if you aren't happy with the food it's your own fault. They have the most wonderful crab rangoon and plenty of chicken, beef and pork dishes to satisfy. Sushi bar too.
5	pos	dev	Great friendly service. All baked goods are freshly home made and they offer great coffee. It is conveniently located right across from the main ski lift at Red River Ski Area and we are looking forward to returning during ski season and enjoying a great cup of coffee and freshly made warm cinnamon rolls in the morning.
5	pos	dev	The atmosphere at Donnato's is quite pleasant. It it's cozy and inviting. The tables are beautifully set with green and red linen. The waitresses although very young, seem to know the foods very well. The food is delicious, savory and to perfection. We started with a Ceasar salad with a vinagrette dressing which was tangy and sweet very soft though. We had some delicious bread sticks with real whipped butter, and the most delicious cajun chicken dish with sausages and shrimp. I requested mine on a scale of 1-10 for spicy, a 4. It was spicy, yet it never disguised the taste of the food. The salmon was done to perfection, with savory spices and butter, both dishes were on a bed of fresh made fettucini. It is my understanding that Donnatos chef was formerly of Franki'es place for ribs, where he turned that restaurant into a number one dining ribs place in Virginia Beach. The only complaint I had about Donnato's were their prices, althought the atmosphere, ambiance and food were a number 5 plus in my book, I feel that the prices are to high. Otherwise, thumps up to donnato's on their selection of foods, and CHEF.
5	pos	dev	I almost hate to post this review, because Latigo Kid is one of our favorite restaurants and I'd hate for it to get busier than it is! Yes, the atmosphere is loungesque BUT the food, margi's and service more than make up for it. Our favorites; chili colorado burrito, chicken chimi's and cheese enchiladas. The margi's are potent so try and limit yourself to 2. We always find the service exceptional and have even tipped the busboys separately for such wonderful attention. They do not take reservations and we are not patient people so we suggest going early before 5pm and you can usually be seated right away. If you are going out for an adult meal ask for a booth since most of the larger parties and families are seated in the back room and it can get a little loud (but jovial). They also serve the entire menu in the bar, great for watching sports on the tube. Adios!
5	pos	dev	Food and Service Not Like Any other. (Relaxing and Enjoyable, With out the Rush)
5	pos	dev	Excellent experience! The atmosphere is fun and comfortable. It is crowded and loud - a fun time if you don't mind that type of thing. Good kids' menu, good drinks for the adults and the seafood was good & hot. Try the hushpuppies - OUT OF THIS WORLD! We're still trying to figure out how to make them like that. Nothing fancy but a whole lot of fun and a cool gift shop, too! Stop by when you're down at Navy Pier.
5	pos	dev	This place is truly a blast. We ate there for my girlfriends B-Day and had the best time. The food is awesome, the waitress was very helpful and professional, and the food was amazing. What a cool spot!!!! And to top it off when we where leaving we saw Keanu reeves eating outside and took a picture with him and my girl, what a way to end the evening. We highly recommend Sushiya!
5	pos	dev	If you love steak with a side of steak get over to Cattleman's Steakhouse , real good eating and plenty of it. From surf and turf to T-bone steaks, you name it they have it, with a full bar to wet your whistle. Every time I am heading back from Sacramento, I make it my point to stop at Cattleman's. Sometimes when Cattleman's get busy there can be a lapse in the service, this has happened to me on several occasions, I ordered an appetizer but it never made it to the table on one occasion. I learned; never order my main course until I physically have my appetizer in custody.
5	pos	dev	Very pleasant dining experience. Only open for lunch, unfortunately. Various vegetarian dishes available which would win over both present vegetarians and meat-eaters. As for atmosphere, this is a place you will just have to experience for yourself. Hot tea is served in miniature cottage-shaped teapots. Sweet tea is made into a true delicacy. If you come to the Pinehurst/Southern Pines area, you will not want to miss Sweet Basil's.
5	pos	dev	WOW You can not miss this place. When we pulled into the parking lot we were greeted to a sight like no other. A huge life sized pirate ship adorned with pirates and a attacking octopus! What a entrance. To the left of the ship sits a lighthouse that is just being build. We were told it will house a gift shop on the first floor and a second floor bar! To the right of the ship is the dock a crab shack atmosphere with a more relaxed vibe and separate menu! Looked like a great place to spend a night! We headed in to find there would be a small wait to get a table. They gave us our number and told us we could wait at the ship or the old bar. We opted for the old bar and were sent down the hall. this was amazing, on either side of the long hallway were old photos of Scranton's past. When we made it to the old bar we snuggled up to the bar and ordered a beer. What kind the bartender asks? Well what do you have I reply. . . oh about 300 bottles and 34 taps!! WOW I Never saw so much beer in my life!! I opted for a frambois (bartender recommended) and was it good! After a short 10 min wait we were buzzed and headed to our table. This place is HUGE! We ate in a nice booth in the WHALE ROOM. This room had a huge whale right in the center of the room. The other room is know as the Train room and has a large train that runs around the room through dioramas. The food here was even better than the decor! We started with some alligator bites, blue crab dip and bayou shrimp to split for appetizers then Lobster dinner, steak, Chicken Parm and Almond Talapia for dinner and everything was wonderful. Our server, Luis, was one of the nicest servers i have ever had. Thank you coopers for a great experience we will definitely return!
5	pos	dev	This is the best place to eat Mexican food in Mount Pleasant. My favorite waiter there is John Holt. If you get there tell him I sent you there. He is a very good waiter. Your glass doesn't stay anywhere near empty and he keeps the chips hot and full. The food is very good and the prices are just right!
5	pos	dev	Over thirty-five Italian restaurants in Tallahassee serve the obligatory pasta, pizza, and calzones. However, obligatory is sometimes not enough. What happens when one gets a hankering for for a creamy, non-gelatinous fettuccine alfredo or bread straight from the oven to the table? My cynical self was pleasantly surprised from beginning to end with Capri; a smallish privately owned restaurant on Apalachee Parkway. For starters, the service was impeccable, friendly and quick. As for the bread, we were given a fresh, hot loaf, complemented by a delicious dipping sauce of olive oil infused with garlic and rosemary. Chopped onions and tomatoes lend an exotic salsa-like dipping experience to the oil. On any salad, I recommend the house dressing, a unique, spicy but light vinaigrette. For a mere $8.25 one can enjoy the baked cannelloni, a tube-like pasta stuffed with ground beef sauteed with onions and oregano, topped with mozzarella cheese and baked in the oven until bubbly. For a more traditional taste, Capri's baked ziti ($7.50) which I prefer with a side of Italian meatballs ($2.50) conjures up reminiscence of fictional summers in Tuscany. Capri's meatballs are incredibly moist and soft, probably because of the egg and fresh breadcrumbs that conglomerate every morsel together. The baked ziti is also baked with the ever-present mozzarella, which clings evenly to every single perfectly al dente noodle. An extensive wine list and full bar adds to every of-age customer's enjoyment, and a vast parking lot ensures a stress free and enjoyable visit. If you must have the obligatory calzone, try mushroom, green pepper and sausage on for size.
5	pos	dev	BAM! is a little hole-in-the-wall in an even smaller town. Their master smoker, John, makes some of the best smoked meats that I've ever had the pleasure to eat. They make their own pastrami and corned beef. I had the pastrami, it melted in my mouth! Their prices run from $5-$10 per entree. The quality of the food is excellent. The staff is extremely friendly. And, the portions are generous.
5	pos	dev	Very cozy and unique bistro/pizzaria. The wood fired pizzas are the highlight of the menu, but do not overlook the extensive appetizers or salads. Very user friendly wine list--- most selections under $30. Waitstaff was personable and helpful. If you are looking for a casual spot to have great food and be pampered-- this is your place.
5	pos	dev	Wonderful experience. Large selection of fresh seafood with many unique preperations. Portions are the right size. Side dishes burst with flavors. Don't miss the red pepper grits. Large windows look onto the street. Color schemes provide a soft tone. Our concern is once the secret of Fish is out it will be hard to get a table
5	pos	dev	Bistro Elan is a wonderful place. The menu changes daily and always has flair. There is an open kitchen, so you may watch the chef do his magic. The food is French with a Californian twist. The decor is simple and elegent, as one would expect from a bistro. It is a bit loud and the tables are close together. The wine list is concise but good. It has become my favorite restuarant.
5	pos	dev	"My favorite flavor is ""grasshopper"" but they've told me it's not a best seller. They serve the best homemade hard ice cream I have EVER tasted. The staff is friendly and efficient and the custom cakes are clever and so nicely done. 7 time winner of the New Jersey State Ice Cream Festival, Sundaes has 2 locations serving Award Winning Homemade Ice Cream in Point Pleasant and Toms River on the Jersey Shore."
5	pos	dev	German sampler was wonderful. Server (Aleishia) was extremly pleasant and knowledgeable. Very nice experience.
5	pos	dev	Best down home cooking. Beautiful log cabin style. Big old time logging equipment in parking area and a little gift shop.
5	pos	dev	Go for the beer selection & to flirt with the lovely wait staff. Halloween was to die for between having to choose between the dark & the white angels and our ever so lovely hostess!!
5	pos	dev	Friendly !! GOOD SERVICE !!! Host to each table, home cookin & fancy combined ! Something for everyone. mention it & they'll try & make it 4 U. Comfortable. No smoking !!
5	pos	dev	My girlfriend and I have ate here about four times and the food and service is great!! The atmosphere is nice and the staff is very friendly and very personable. The price is great for the food. I can't say enough about this restaurant. I will return to eat here many more times and if you're looking for a great authentic indian restaurant, then try Essence of India.
5	pos	dev	We were greeted at the entrance by a VERY friendly hostess, named Maiko. Since there were 6 of us we explained that we were sorry we didn't make reservations, we didn't realize there would be that many dining with us that evening. She assured it it was no problem, and sat us immediately @ a table with a BEAUTIFUL view of the ocean. As we sat there in silence trying to decide what to order (everything on the menu sounded WONDERFUL) we noticed the pianist. He was VERY talented, and made the atmosphere the most pleasant I've ever been in. As we listened we realized he could play just about everything, so my 19 year old neice walked over and requested a song. Right away he began playing AND singing the song, and allowed my neice to sit @ the piano and sing along! We ordered our food after that, which we all ended up getting dinner buffett bc we could not choose. Everything up there, from the asparagus chicken to the fresh mahi-mahi- was undescribable. We would recommened this place to anyone! By the way, my neice who sang with the pianinst, Donnie, is now 24, and looking foward to having her wedding reception there, with Donnie as the pianinst, ofcourse.
5	pos	dev	What a wonderful find. Nestled amongst live oaks, recirculating stream with falls, patio dining, live music on the weekends, Everyone ordered differently and we shared bites. Each plate was as delicious as the other. Tuna perfectly cooked with lemon caper butter, Tenderloin very tender and nicely complimented with a mildly spicey green peppercorn sauce, Rack of lamb superb and the ostrich ( on a dare ) was excellent. We are new to town and will be going there often.
5	pos	dev	Great food, huge portions, you won't be able to finish your meal. Good prices, huge menu. Their onion rings, cole slaw and fisherman's platter are great.
5	pos	dev	It is the best Thai food that I have every experienced. I have tried quite a few Thai restaurants and this one far surpasses in cleanliness, presentation, amount of food served, price and best of all taste! It is excellent! We order by phone and pick up for lunch at work. We order and pick up for dinner. We also take anyone from out of town there for dinner so they can see what a great experience to dine there. Staff are excellent also. I rate it 10 on a scale of 1 to 5.
5	pos	dev	We started with Spinach and Artichoke Dip. Served with tortilla chips. It was very tastey. I odered the ribs. They were full of flavor and not chewy. Tender and the meat came right off the bone. My husband had a Reuben. The best he's had in a long while. The outside was grilled to perfection and the inside was layered with just the right amount of each ingredient. My sister-in-law had a giant Spinach Salad. It was served with their house dressing, a sweet/sour vinegerette. She said thats why she goes there. My brother-in-law orered an 8oz char crusted Butt Steak. He said med rare and it was just a touch over that, but fairly close. He said the char crust has alot of flavor and he enjoyed it. For dessert we split two different things. We had Apple Strudel with cinnimon ice cream and the Key Lime Pie with rasberry sauce. YUM! We had a familar waitress and she is always very plesant and efficiant. The owner is always around making sure we had a great time. We keep going back for the best prices and good food.
5	pos	dev	This is the best place to get a great roast beef sandwich and French fries, Their orange pop is fantastic. I wish I lived there I would frequent the restaurant. I just loved it! And being from Colorado, I wish they would franchise here. KUDOS to you!!!!
5	pos	dev	We were traveling back to Michigan, late in the day, and took a chance on the sample menu in our motel room. What a surprising and pleasurable discovery, could not have been better, charm, decor, atmosphere, service, wonderful food, came away feeling that we now had friends in Platte City
5	pos	dev	This place was awesome! Visited the Village of Cold Spring for a day trip to see the foliage in the mountains...what a treat to say the least. Cold Spring is 1 hour north of NYC on the metro line and you would never believe the scenic views. Reknown for its antiquing, that is only one attribute to this amazing historic village. Something like 150 hiking trails with views of the gorgeous Hudson Valley, kayak rides and of course, the dining. Which brings me to just about the middle of Main Street, on the north side of the street was this kitchy looking sign, East Side Kitchen. I was drawn in by the music on the patio, tunes of Billie Holiday, Bob Wills, Beatles-Live at the BBC, and other selective but obscure artists. Walked in to an incredible 1940's atmosphere with a soda bar, antique milkshake machine and an abundance of jazz musicans on the walls joining us in this elaborate experience. This place was eye candy! But the experience doesn't stop there...had a great waitress, very pleasant and great with my children. A very kid-friendly place, even had a kids menu and crayons for artwork which they hang on the walls for others to see. The food was incredible! Homeade food, no doubt, and the portions were perfect. Prices were very reasonable for such a tourist adventure. Washed down my rotisserie chicken with a glass of Guenoc Chardonnay, an obsure wine which happens to be one of my favorites, and for dessert...an Egg Cream! Loved this place! Strongly recomend a day trip to the Village and great lunch/dinner at the East Side Kitchen!
5	pos	dev	I have been going to Riccardo's Pizza since I moved to Browns Mills in 1989 and we all love it! Vito and his staff always makes the family feel welcome and ALWAYS makes my kids smile while waiting for our food. I think the sauce is the best in town, and I am very picky about my sauce. The prices are great, the business is always clean, and the service is prompt and courteous. Very enjoyable...Perfecto Vito!
5	pos	dev	More food than should be allowed by law is served up with a heavy dose of service. If you are looking for more bang for the buck, The Cheesecake Factory located inside Macys on Union Square has it all. The owners really need to build another restaurant in the city since the wait for a table can be as long as two hours. And you cannot leave without trying some of their desserts. One warning: The appetizers are large portionsand will fill you up so use caution when ordering, you might miss the incredible main course or dessert!
5	pos	dev	This place is amazing, the setting is an ante-bellum house, beautifully restored and made into a quasi-European bistro, the chef (Terry) is nothing short of worldclass and the food is spectacular, the waiters were amazingly attentive and ready to serve with a smile. I would suggest the Tuna, and the French Onion Soup. Enjoy!
5	pos	dev	Found Sushi Dake in the Yellow Pages, and decided to try it out w/ my boyfriend. It's a friendly place, where the owners are personable and concerned with making your experience a pleasant one. There are pictures of customers all over the restaurant, and the atmosphere is casual and friendly and fun. The food is delicious - we tried sushi (fresh and yummy) and regular menu items (salmon teriyaki, udon, & oysters). It's a great place, and we're definitely going there from now on! :)
5	pos	dev	The Best pizza in the U.S.!!! Better than anywhere in NYC. Don't miss this place!!!
5	pos	dev	After a long day of business, my friend and I decided to try todai. I went to the one in Hong Kong, so I knew it was excellent, and the one in puente hills mall is no exception. Although we had to wait an hour before it opened for dinner, it was well worth the wait as we were greeted with a kind and professional staff. We were first to get there and the food was incredibly fresh (the waitress gave us a freshly baked lobster!), and the presentation was a work of art. You would think for the price, you would expect a low class sushi restaurant, but instead we got great service and even better food. Overall, I was looking for negatives in this restaurant but I could not find anything wrong with the Puente Hills Todai. If you are looking for a great environment and great food, this is the place to be.
5	pos	dev	The food here was the best we have found in Rockport! (After 3 visits!!) The local shrimp was excellent and should be tried, if given the chance. You can dine and watch the harbor activity while eating. This restaurant is not as elegant-looking as some, but don't let it fool you!! It's fantastic!!!
5	pos	dev	Very good food, and very good service. We love to entertain our friends there.
5	pos	dev	"Excellent BBQ ""joint"". Catfish was good, but the ribs were the ""bomb""! Smoked to perfection, tender but not sloppy, and covered with a sauce that will make you cry like you 've just seen God.There is a ""Hot"" sauce that will numb your lips, however I preferred the milder sauce. That way you can get down and dirty. DON'T FORGET YOUR BIB!"
5	pos	dev	"What a quaint, out of the way little place. Commercial places are fine, but getting back to the ""Old World"" cuisine of this little place was a delightful change. No hype, just good food.."
5	pos	dev	Great combination of Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine that is excellant in presentation, quantity and presentation. Atmosphere is family friendly with the owner, Sam greeting you at the door. Sam will make changes to dishes to match your tastes. Try the Grilled chicken lo mein. We plan on going back often.
5	pos	dev	My girlfriend took me out for my birthday and we were going to Bin 941. There was a 45 minute wait at Bin (which is next door) I had heard Lickerish was good so I suggested we go there. Upon first glance at the menu we thought it seemed a little pricy for tapas, but do not let that fool you. The food was excellent and the portions were ample. The server was friendly and very helpful. The Kobe Beef Sashimi with Risotto was amazing. I have been recommending it to all my friends and plan to go back very soon. November 2002
5	pos	dev	Best italian food with a great value for money. Staff very helpfull and friendly and very attentive to guests request. A place to go for a very good meal
5	pos	dev	You can cut the Steak with a fork Great place with friendly staff and quick service.
5	pos	dev	Soon Dooboo! Bulgogi! Nebayaki! Tempura Udon! Katsudon! And much, much more! An underrated food court and definitely a hidden treasure for gastronomes out there, Lotte is a haven for Asians, food adventurers and foodies in general. Its façade resembles an ordinary supermarket, however, step inside and you are transformed into a different universe. Exotic produce and delicacies invite you to explore and get lost in the freshness--- the smell of fresh fish, seafood, poultry, pork and beef line their full service area; aromatic fruits and veggies that you wouldn't find in any other grocery, you will find here. And the dry goods are not to be ignored, either. Noodles galore, marinades, shrimp paste, sardines, kimchi, tofu, seaweed, salmon flakes, shrimp crackers, dumplings, lychee jello, seasoned bonito with sesame seed mix you get the picture. Venture in a little more, and you find yourself surrounded by kitchenware (where you will find items that appear in Pottery Barn, Crate & Barrel and the like but for ridiculously LOW prices!), appliances, textiles, and the oh-so-cute Sanrio corner. It's as close to New York's Chinatown as we can get here in Maryland, so indulge me if you please! Now I get to the best part; what I am to boast about now is the food court Lotte has, that's tucked away in the very back of this emporium. Slabs of varnished wood for tables and wood stumps for chairs; the ambiance is what you make of it. Cafeteria style, clean and very casual, you are then engulfed by Japanese, Korean and Chinese food stalls, all luring you with the smells of authenticity soup stocks, grilled entrees, spices, fresh sushi, stews, etc. Not to mention the VALUE of these meals! Last Sunday, hubby and I had brunch there. He ordered his usual Soon Dooboo: Soft Tofu in Spicy Clam Stewstill bubbling, served with Rice, Kimchi and pickled radish ($6.25). I had a Combo: Big Bowl of Seaweed Udon, Tonkatsu (breaded pork cutlets with a sweet brown sauce) Rice and Side Salad for $7.00. The portions of the entrees and accompaniments are very generous! Each of our meals alone could easily have fed two people. Excellent fresh flavors and low prices, you can't go wrong with that! Plus your grocery shopping's just about done, too. LOTTE PLAZA locations in MD: North Bethesda, Silver Spring and Ellicott City (I refer to this above)
5	pos	dev	This an absolutely unreal place to eat! The prices are more than fair, they wait on you hand and foot and they make the wait fun for children by providing crayons & coloring paper for them! It is just an overall fantastic place to be!
5	pos	dev	The food was exquisite. I decided on trying fish, im not really much of a fish eater, I had the barbeque salmon. It was great. The waiter was very polite, and the waitresses, it didn't matter if it was there table or not, if they saw you were low on water or had an empty plate in front of you, they were more than happy to help. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to family and friends. Keep up the good work.
5	pos	dev	A very lucky find for us. My husband was trying to impress his clients...and so he did. Very pleasant atmosphere. Now the food! The bread and dip alone is sooo good, but the food is worth writing about. The service was quick and very friendly, but again...the food...we had veal picata (you don't need a knife) and Shrimp Arina named after the owners mother. Delicious! You must try Veneto...again and again! I know we will!
5	pos	dev	I went here three times for lunch. On each occasion I tried something new. The lunch menu is pretty extensive, and a good value. Everything was fresh and served quickly. Most dishes hover around the $6-7 range. Service was attentive. The decor is quaint as it intends to give you the feel of dining in an outdoor square. Nice music piped in. (I didn't see the live music they have on weekends.) I felt comfortable in casual dressno pretenses here.
5	pos	dev	The best tasting pizza in the world and a great price and fast efficient service
5	pos	dev	Good Food, Arrived at Dinner time, prices are great, service was excellent, Food was Ohhhhhh Soooooo Good !!!!
5	pos	dev	Our server was wonderful--very caring and sweet. The food was delicious. I had the Shrimp Florentine Au Gratin Pasta and I have never tasted anything better! My husband's food was also great. Everything they serve is homemade and you can really tell. They also serve a Champagne Brunch on the weekends that is amazing!!!
5	pos	dev	Casa Mexicana is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Huntsville. The food and service is always great. And, the prices are extremely reasonable. The atmosphere is wonderful. Restaurant has always been nice and clean.
5	pos	dev	It was delightful!
5	pos	dev	Very flavorable steaks! Brook is an outstanding waitress. You do not feel rushed and can enjoy the dining out experience.
5	pos	dev	If you like to eat meat and are in the surroundings of the beautiful Veracruz, MX, here's an amazing place to eat: Cacharrito. My wife and I ate there on a very special date, and were impressed (yes, IMPRESSED) by the taste of the meat, and the SIZE of the pieces. Didn't eat such a meat in twenty years! We were happy to be served a side salad to help, and some kind of local sangria - with very little alcohol. Could not reach the deserts menu since we were already full. The manager, Jaime Garcia, is a very nice person that helped us along. And the valet parking was a nice little plus in this crowded street. We'll eat there again!
5	pos	dev	Best Mexican in the state! Not a large themed restaurant, just a spot in a strip mall- original food with lots of it for very little money.
5	pos	dev	Nino's Italian Bakery just moved to Menomonee Falls from the East side of Milwaukee. When some friends and I heard they made subs we went in for lunch the next day. They blow the competition out of the water. You gotta try 'em!!!
5	pos	dev	"This is just a simple Lexington Style BBQ joint. But the food is excellent, the sweet tea is awesome, and the prices are comparable to fast food. Lexington Style BBQ is hard to describe, but it all starts with hickory smoked pork shoulder, topped with BBQ slaw and BBQ dip, on a bun or you can order a BBQ plate(same stuff without the bun). Even if BBQ isn't your style (and I can't believe there are people like that!!! *L*) they have a wide menu to choose from, and it's all good ""down-home"" cooking. Troutman's is WAY off the Chamber of Commerce tour, but it's worth the diversion!!!"
5	pos	dev	ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN TOWN! WE WOULD DRIVE MILES TO GO AND HAVE DINNER THERE. THE WAITSTAFF IS GREAT. THE CHINESE DRINKS ARE INTOXICATING! THANKS.
5	pos	dev	I planned my sons rehearsal dinner for 35 guests. From the moment I began the plans the staff at the Aria were accomodating and pleasant. The service was impecable, the food incrediable, the atmosphere elegant. I could not have been more pleased. I would recomend it for all special occassions. They have a broad range of banquet menus to choose from.
5	pos	dev	"Joe T's is the primary restaurant for all of my family get togethers, we've been going since 1982, usually about once a month, though for a large part of the 90's I was there every Friday night. It is simply the best enchilada dinner I have been served in all of Dallas/Ft. Worth. But the real gem is the margarita, on the rocks, no salt for me. None better. Yes there is a sign requesting patrons to judge the food over the service, but in 22 years and well over 300 trips there, I have never had what I would call ""terrible"" service. The owners run a tight ship, their people never stop moving and my drink is never empty. The regulars are there for the food, drinks and general beautiful atmosphere, it's the globally uptight people who take offense to a team of servers quickly walking up to your table with a tray of enchiladas and with assembly line speed and precision, serve up your plate in a sort of wham-bam matter. It's all about the food, and the faster it gets to my table, the better. Bring cash, no credit cards, but an ATM was recently installed."
5	pos	dev	We've been to Rick's twice. The 1st time we went for dinner and I ordered Filet Mignon. It was the best steak I have ever eaten. The 2nd time we just went for drinks and appetizers. We ordered several different ones. All were great. The atmosphere was great. I would HIGHLY recommend !
5	pos	dev	This family style restaurant is a timeless classic! White linen on the tables with all-you-can-eat family style food - - wonderful fried chicken with mounds of mashed potatoes and gravy. Service is always excellent. Reservations definitely required - they seem to handle large groups well. Great place to take Grandma and Grandpa for a special occasion!
5	pos	dev	This place is awesome. It's a sports bar that has amazing food. The service is excellent, which is even more rare in a sports bar! Salads are fresh, soups are hot and taste home-made, and if you have an issue, the owner is there just about every night (her name is Connie, and she knows what goes on in her place). There's another location on Warm Springs by Sunset Station that's just as good.
5	pos	dev	Italian Delicatessen that boasts their HOT daily specials. The sandwich menu is just as good! They have excellent imported Italian lunch meats and Nice, Nice, Nice people behind the counter. A cool place hidden within the confines of an office building... Yet another hidden gem in the Chicagoland area.
5	pos	dev	Thai cuisine with a splash of French is the best way I can describe this combination. This is a small restaurant in and old store front that is off on a side street in Somervill, NJ.; Reminds me of places in the Village (NYC). However people line up outside to be seated so reservations are recommended. The blending of Thai and French is interesting, most of the menu is Thai in origin. For an Appetizer I had the Shrimp Sate', (Shrimp crust cake on a skewer, with plum sauce and cucumber). It was absolutely delicious, the ingredients were very fresh. For the main course I had the Original Duck Tamarind, (One half duck, boneless and roasted crisp, serve with Asian eggplant, kiwi and tamarind sauce. It was outstanding, all the different flavors were blended amazingly together. Unlike some other Thai food that can be dominated with hot spices, Origin gets it right with just the right amount of kick. No additional seasoning is required once you get your dish. I ate my plate squeaky clean, the portions are just right. For dessert I had pistachio ice cream (most of the dessert is Western). The staff is of Thai ethnicity, they are very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is very clean, and the decor pleasantly simple with Thai accents. The prices are very reasonable, my appetizer was $8 and my Entree was $17. It is BYOB, so friend brought two bottles of wine, one red and one white.
5	pos	dev	Awesome Thai Chicken Wrap!
1	neg	dev	Snobbish attitude of waiter set us off instantly, but the fate of the night was sealed when a 2-inch cockroach crawled up my leg during dinner. The fact that no restaurant employee seemed concerned, including the owner, ensured that we'll never set foot in this overrated establishment again.
1	neg	dev	"Tried this place tonight for the first time and we will never go back. The menu price for the buffet was $19.95 however our waiter told us that they just raised the price to $23.95. He then explained that if we didn't get crab legs that it was only 15.95. I went with the crab legs included. As I walked into the buffet area I was shocked to see how crowded and cramped it was in there. I didnt see a single non-fried piece of seafood on the buffet. I then decided that I would just make a meal out of the crab legs so I got in the ""crab leg line"". After waiting in line for 5-10 minutes, quess what? No more crab legs except for a few scraps. If my wife wasnt already eating at this time I would of stormed out with her. I have seen better buffets in hospital cafeterias. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
3	neg	dev	$65 for a platter of stone crabs, per person, is a bit much for lunch. But they were great and very filling. The wait in the bar was very long so I'm not sure I'll go back - but it was an experience to go to a place so many people rave about. I remember the old days at Joe's, in a much smaller restaurant on the same site, when you slipped the maitre d' a $20 and got in right away! If you're in a hurry, find someplace else as the wait time is not worth the price.
3	neg	dev	I just go visit a friend in MD and they suggest me this restaurant. I´m from Peru, and here we don´t have too much good restaurants. The bartenders were good and the prices ok.
1	neg	dev	"WE ARRIVED FOR OUR 7:30 RESERVATION. WERE SEATED PRETTY TIMELY. WAS NOT ACKOWLEDGED BY A WAITRESS FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. WHEN WE ORDERED WE WERE RUSHED. WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCOMODATE MY VEGETARIAN DATE, AS PROMISED ON THE PHONE. OUR SALAD ARRIVED ABOUT 20 MINUTES AFTER ORDERING. AND BY 8:55 OUR DINNER STILL DID NOT ARRIVE, NOR WERE WE ACKNOWLEDGED BY OUR WAITRESS UNTIL WE ASKED. SHE REPLIED "" I HAVE A PARTY OF 17 OVER THERE AND WHEN I AM DONE WITH THEM I WILL GET TO YOU! MY GUESS IS THAT THE CHEF CAN ONLY HANDLE ONE TABLE AT A TIME??! IT WAS RIDICULOUS. THE FOOD LOOKED GOOD, BUT THE ONLY APOLOGY WE GOT WAS WHEN WE WERE WALKING OUT THE DOOR. THERE WAS ONE WAITRESS AND ONE BUS BOY TO ABOUT 20 TABLES. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!"
2	neg	dev	It's a little dive cafe right off the square. I gave it a shot instead of the other restuarants because every now and then you find a little hidden treasure in these places, but it wasn't the case here. I left hungry and I never like that.
3	neg	dev	Another of the everyday gyro places that serve the same gyro's. They also have the standard sandwhich fare....Italian Beef was my order. Cool thing about this place was the a drive-up. Food was really FAST so that scores extra points as well.
1	neg	dev	Over rated! The pricing here is absolutely outrageous. An $60 surcharge on an $85 5oz wagyu steak that wasn't prepared correctly? Ridiculous! Take the money you will waste here and fly to the French Laundry in Napa. What a rip off.
1	neg	dev	Well afer a time of Christmas shopping we were ready to eat, and decided we couldn't wait for a table and to grab some good food at the bar. My husband and I watched the bar guy serving, sweat was literally dripping off him and was already to go into the many drinks he was serving up to the whole restaurant! I watched him and he did not look well. He was constantly wiping himself down sometimes with a cloth that looked yuk! and then with his hands. Oh glory!! with all the germs that go around no wonder there are so many people getting ILL!!!lLACK OF SIMPLE HYGIENE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE FOOD AND DRINK TO THE PATRONS HAS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY!!!.. We left feeling very disappointed and hungry. My husband returned to see the manager and all he could say was that a lot of people sweat.... and that he was sorry that we would not be returning to Max's .... I guess for us seeing droplets of sweat going into people's drinks was something we did not want to see!! let alone into our food!! I have had only wonderful experiences at Max's in the past and through the many years since it opened in the 80's. I guess those days may be gone!.. I would have liked to have asked this manager does he normally like to eat food and drink being served up to him with droplets of sweat all over the place?! yuk! yuk! yuk!!
1	neg	dev	Let me start by saying that, my daughter and I go out to eat at least once a week, and when I find a place to go that we like we become somewhat regulars. I have driven by the hilltop restaurant for several years now but it wasn't untill i recieved a cupon in the mail did i decide to try them. When ariving at the restuarant and going in side it looked like your typical small mom & pop kind of place. We found our way back to the back room and on our way let the waitress know we were there. After about 10 min. she arived with some water and took our drink orders. It was another 10 min. before she came back again with our drinks. We told her we were ready to order and she said she would be rite back, Well you guessed it it was about 5 min before we seen her again. So we finally give her our order my daughter has the chicken fried steak dinner and i order the steak dinner medium rare with baked potato and a vegi. 20 minuets latter our food arives and in that time we did not see our waitress again. The food looked good, and my daughters meal was very much to her liking. But my steak had a funny taste to it I cut a peice and ate it thinking that they must use a very strange seasoning, I tried 2 more bites and just didnt like it but it was on the 4th cut that I was able to tell just what the problem was, as I brought the peice of meat up to my nose I could smell that the steak was spoiled. Not wanting to make a sceen I approached the waitress in the hallway away from all the other customers and let her know of the problem. She took my plate back to the cook and when she returned to my table she told me that the cook said there was nothing wrong with the steak and gave it back. Well needless to say i did not eat it, and i sat and waited for my daughter to finish her meal. When she was done we went to the front counter and waited again for our waitress to finaly come and tally up our bill (I was feeling kind of invisable) We talked about the steak and I asked her to have the cook taste it, and when he did you could see on his face that there was something wrong. when she came back I was informed that because i didnt bring it to her attention Quick enough that there was nothing they could do. They did however offer to cook me another steak to take home with me. But at this point I was not going to sit and wait another 20 min. So I let her know that i would just pay the check, and let every person who would listen to my story know about my experience at The Hilltop Restaurant. That was the most expensive baked potato I have ever eaten. Thank you for allowing me this venue to give my review.
1	neg	dev	"Date of visit: 8/31/03 I can sum this establishment up in one word - HORRIBLE! The service was bad, the staff was unfriendly and the food was the worst I've had. I ordered chicken fajitas and the chicken was slimy and soft. It didn't taste like any chicken I've had. The server never checked to see if our meal was okay. I had to flag him down to complain and he didn't even seem to care. And when I explained to the manager what was wrong with my dish, he just looked at me like I was crazy and responded, ""We won't charge you for the fajitas, but we'll have to charge you for the side dish."" The side dish that consisted of a scoop of guacamole, a scoop of sour cream and some pico de gallo. Yeah, that was worth $6! I will never go there again and would advise anyone and everyone - Stay Away!"
1	neg	dev	This was one of the worst dinning experiences of my life. my childrens burgers were very dry and the rest of my parties stated that there food was just ok. Server was not attentive and had to contiusly ask other servers for condiments and refill on drinks. Contacted there web-site and complained. Heard back from corporate office asurring that the manager would contact me. Been a week and like the food and service-its a no show.
3	neg	dev	"Hong Kong Buffet is on my list of ""Chinese"" buffet's. Where as I've had ""authentic"" chinese food in downtown china-town, and other places. For your quick and easy slightly simple buffet's... this is as average as get out. Think Mos Eisley cantina, minus the live paid entertainment, a fresh crop of non english speaking chinese teenagers every 4 months, and moderatly better clientele. And hey, I go there so much the matre'd knows to warn the new help to not curse me out in chinese when I try to order in mandarin."
3	neg	dev	French Quarter location of a local multi unit. Large portions of basic local favorites. Large open areas can accomidate many people. Draft bears are served in frozen glasses that resemble a gold fish bowl. If you are interested in oysters don't wait on line at tourist traps. Deanie's serves some of the best.
1	neg	dev	This is overpriced Kentucky Fried Chicken in a dingey old house in a back street in Crested Butted. Unbelievable prices for a very basic meal. KFC is tastier anyway. Outrageous!!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste your money.
1	neg	dev	The experience was definitely not worth the price we paid for our meal. The filet mignon tasted like cardboard and had huge gristles in it. My husband's NY strip was broiled and that took all the flavor right out of it. The guy who filled our water glasses bumped into my husbands hand twice when he refilled his glass, without apologizing or saying anything, and although the waitress was friendly, she didn't visit our table much at all and seemed unconcerned when we said something about the bad food. After hearing many compliments about Sunset, we were excited about eating there, but I wouldn't eat there again even if the meal was free. And if anyone tells you their Strawberry Shortcake is to die for, don't believe it!
3	neg	dev	Difficult review as this used to be Devonsleigh Place, a definite 5 star. New owners redecorated and renamed it Prime Steakhouse. Located in NE Toronto - Warden & Steeles area. We found the food was not yet up to Devonsleigh standards in quality, quantity or reasonable pricing, but they do seem to be anxious to get your suggestions for improvement. Waiters seem overworked but friendly. Escargots good, not great. $7 Wild Mushroom soup very good. $9 Lobster Bisque - fantastic, best I've ever had. $16 Oysters Rockefeller poor - served almost raw. Iceberg Wedges ordinary - not enough dressing $7. For a steakhouse, there isn't a lot of 'creativity' with the steaks available - just $32-38 12 oz - 16 oz NY Strips (no peppercorn), $42 28 oz Rib Steaks, 8-12 oz $27-37 Fillet, 16oz $36 Rib Eye, $32 Veal Chop and $36 Lamb Chop. No Steak Diane. Prime Rib $28 12 oz not great. Seafood Platter $110 for two, has crab legs, lobster tail, shrimps, scallops, and salmon...it used to be better with great scampi and a full lobster per person instead of a tail. Sides are now extra - no salad included anymore, baked potato now $6 instead of included. Nothing outstanding with the desserts, and the $10 chocolate platter is a waste. Wine selection and prices reasonable. Drink portions small. Prime Steakhouse will improve with age and is probably the best restaurant in the area.
1	neg	dev	"last week in London for business trip,after meeting we went out for a dinner in China town.we need to wait 30 min for a sit even we had made a reservation 2 days before.The reason is they forget the reservation.After be seated,we been serve by a waiting staff who cannot understand English.We had to place our order with 3 different waiting staff and finally brought us a wrong order.The waiting staff is rude especially a lady that we do a complait.She told us that ""this is China town,what you expected?"". The dishes was terrible,cold food and the taste is definately bad.This was the worst chinese food i ever had in my life.Lastly,we had to pay GBP160.00 for 2 bottles of wine and 5 dishes.The bill was extremely expensive and they refuse to check the bill for us."
1	neg	dev	Long waiting for getting seats. Took 20 mins for getting the change back.
3	neg	dev	"Brew Brothers is located in the ElDorado Hotel and Casino. Very good food and good brews. In addition to ""pub food"", there is a nice wood fired pizza selection."
3	neg	dev	Nothing Special. Prices High----$4.95 for soup and $4.95 for sald for basic Applebee's quality food.
1	neg	dev	I used to go here..... This place has been under new ownership since 2003. The food has gone downhill. The general manager is a joke. The menu does not stay the same, they took a local tavern and tried to make it into a Fridays...I would say walk (run) away from this place. Oh did I mention that you can get much better food over on 8th st. Try Marty's for burgers and Starfish for brunch.
1	neg	dev	I live 7 minutes from Olga's and totally agree with the other reviews. I don't know why their parking lot is always full, but I guess there's a first time for everyone at this place. I think the only thing I've ever liked, after eating at Olga's sporadically since like age 5 or younger, would be the grilled cinnamon bun with butter on it. And that's it. I despise this place and it's nothing but a South Jersey landmark that they should revamp totally or perhaps knock down and just leave the sign for nostalgia's sake.
1	neg	dev	You can't modify the burger your supposed to be paying $10 dollars for. They make a blue-cheese lovers only burger. You would think thats important to people to be able to get what they want but I guess not the place is always crowded.
1	neg	dev	Yuck!
2	neg	dev	Our first time to this restaurant,we drove nearly an hour, only to find that we had to wait yet another hour past our reservation, in the cold and vastly crowded lobby, listening to, and jossled by fellow patrons with the same complaint; several leaving in disgust. When we were finally seated, our overwhelmed waitress apologized for the slow service and no explanation was offered upon inquiry. The food was good; the prices reasonable. However, I am not sure I wish to repeat that kind of experience.
3	neg	dev	A decent pub with average pub food. Nothing special about the food, but a great beer selection. My complaint was more about the service. Basically, you order your food at the bar, go sit down, and wait for your number to be called even though they had waitresses for liquor service.
2	neg	dev	I ordered the chicken pasta dish and it was awful. The chicken seemed like some kind of frozen chicken fingers that had been thrown on the grill with no seasoning and they were dry and hard. The pasta was barely warm and the sauce was just ok. I will say the margarita was good and a good price but I would never go there to eat again.
3	neg	dev	My family and I have been going to the Olga's on 12 mile and Southfield for years and have never had a problem. Last night we went to the one in Oakland Mall and a woman named Yolonda was extremely rude to us. There is no excuse for the way we were treated. I have never felt so disrespected. I would hate to turn people away from Olgas simply because of one persons cruelty, but I definitely don't plan to go back to the Olgas at Oakland mall and I hope this woman has major consequences.
3	neg	dev	The food is not good at all. It does not even taste like Mexican food. It is kinda chewy, over saucey and has a bland taste. But my parents have taken me to this place at least 10 times a year since I was born. I am now 32 years old and take my 5 children here often. I also like to spend my Birthdays here too. I love this place!! It has a lot of memories for me! I love the live band, the diving, the gorilla, the puppet show, black barts cave and the little shop!! I would go there more, probably every week if they improved their food. The sopapillas are great though!! The staff is also very pleasent! I hope Casa Bonita stands forever!! God Bless
3	neg	dev	Amazon has a spicy black sauce that it uses on it's blackened salmon and shrimp dishes that is out of this world. I've only gone there for lunch, and the atmosphere is very relaxed, like the inside of a cave with a large waterfall feature in the center. The black beans and rice are good, the grilled vegetables are ok, and the grilled plantains are fine. The service is fine at lunch, and the same waitress has been there for years. She says the chef has moved on to another restaurant, but they pay him royalties to keep using the sweet hot black sauce that Amazon is known for.
2	neg	dev	She ordered shrimp fra Diablo it was so hot she couldn't taste the shrimp she has 25 yrs in restaurant business this is her fav dish manager says fra Diablo means hot you know never offered a replacement meal took it off the bill but she was hungry toooo.
1	neg	dev	"This was the worst experience I ever had at any resturant. The service was unexceptable. I was first of all seated in a dirty area, the napkins and silverware was in the seat, a sticky substance was on the table, and after asking the waitress to wipe the table, she grabbed a dirty napkin from the table behind her and wiped it. When she came to get our drink order, she came back with the wrong drinks. After we accepted the drinks she brought, we had to wait approx. 45 min. before she took our order, of course by now a few of the glasses were empty, and when one of the ladies ask to have her tea refilled, she said she had to find the pitcher of tea. However when she did come to refill the glass there was no ice and the lady ask her to bring a glass of ice, it never came. I placed my order for the 20 wings as my appetizer, and the combo platter to go when I was about to leave. I ask the waitress if I could get the wings with all flats no drummetts, she said they don't do that you have to get it the way it is. I explained to her that I had order them this way before. She said a wing is a wing what difference does it make? I told her it made a big difference to me because I don't care for the white meat. She said she don't eat wings so she didn't know what I was talking about. I asked her could she ask them to do it anyway. After waiting another 30 to 45 mins., she brought the other appetizers, I asked if they were going to fix the wings, she said yes they are working on them now. After the other ladies finished their appetizers and she came to move the plates, I asked what was the hold-up on the wings? She said, ""Oh, did you want them buffalo?"" I said ""I thought they were already working on them?"" They are, do you want them spicy or not? She return about 10 mins. later with the combo platter that I asked her to fix to go before I left. After telling her that I wanted that to go before I leave because I want it to be warm when I get home, she said well I can put this one in a carry-out. Now I'm calling for the manager to inform him of the service we were getting. He did bring me 10 of the wings and told me he would bring the next 10 in a few mins. I also told him I wanted the combo to go, and not the one she had brought about 1 hour ago. I then asked her what time the bus came, she asked what bus, I told the one you are going to miss. She said, I ain't miss no bus. The manager then bring my wings, but I asked if I could get a carry-out for them now because everyone else is just about done. She came back about 5 mins. later with another plate of wings, (not all flats) and I told her the manager had already got them for me and he went to put them with the rest of my order. She put them on the table and said well this is what they had in the window for you. I told her, well just take them back, I have mine. She said, well I'm sorry!!! I said ""I know"" and she walked off. While waiting for the check we start to laugh and talk with each other. She passed by the table while we were talking, she stopped and looked at us and said ""Your rudeness is not necessary."" I asked her what did she mean, she said you""ll over laughing. I said you don't know what we are laughing about. She said it don't matter, you called me sorry. I said ""I didn""t call you anything, you call yourself sorry. She came over towards me so I stood up. One of the ladies in my party got up and told her to go ahead and get our checks, she said she wasn't going anywhere until she finish her job. I then said, ""baby you need to go on and do your job, I don't have time for this childish stuff, I'm old enough to be your mother. She then told me the best thing for me to do was sit down. EXCUSE ME? I asked her who she thought she was talking to because I was not the one. We ask to see the manager before we asked for the check, when he did come we asked him what was the problem, he said he told her to tell us he would be there in a minute because he was still trying to correct some problems with another customer. She never told us anything. When she came back to the table to collect, she would not take my money. I had to call another manager to take my money. I then explained to this manager the service we had received, he took my money and apologized for her behavior. First of all, she should not have had the attitde, and then she should have been the one to apologize. We eat at this same location at least 3 times a month, always a group of 5 to 20 people. She left a very negative impression on us all. We spend $100.00 or more everytime we come, so this really make us feel that our patronage is not appreciated. I hope no one else will have to experience what we did, there or anywhere. This visit left a very bitter taste in my mouth. Not to mention it was one of the ladies birthday and she told her if they sing to her and give her a cake, she would have to pay for it. She never brought it. The second manager did get it for her as we were leaving. Please respond to this letter to let me know if you acknowledge the review. The waitress was Dana, first manager was Tony and the second manager was Eddie. Thanks for concern and response."
3	neg	dev	The restaurant is in a nice location, and the food is alright. We like it there, although the waitresses are a little young! My wife ordered a clam chowder soup, and she got an.... onion soup! And my grilled salmon, if well cooked, was really small.....
2	neg	dev	First, the atmosphere was OK. Nothing overly nice, just OK. The concept of bringing meats wrapped in siran wrap to the table and having the server endlessly drone on about them is awful. Who wants to see a steak wrapped in plastic? And, what good does that do me, the patron? It's a dumb gimmick and should be stopped. On to the food: for starters we had the scallops wrapped in bacon and the grilled asparagus. Both tasted fine, but were way over-priced. 3 scallops for 12 bucks is a bit much -- even if your name is Mortons. Since they tasted OK, I had no real problem with the price. Where I really had a problem was with the big event -- my porterhouse was pretty much awful. I've had much better at restaurants at half the price and in my own kitchen. It was cooked by someone who clearly knew nothing about cooking steak. And, the quality of the cut left much to be desired. My wife had the filet Oskar, which seemed OK, other than the fact that there were two, count them two, medium sized pieces of crabmeat on the entire plate. The whole idea of Oskar is crabmeat and asparagus over a meat. Again, premium price for crappy food. Mashed potaties were any basic version. Mushrooms were over-powered with garlic. Wine was way over-priced, but was well-presented. Overall, this is not even in the top ten steak places in a city that has generally lousy restaurants. Hey Mr. Morton, you can't live off your name forever -- people who like good food will figure you out!
3	neg	dev	Although listed as American, this is strictly Jamaican food. We arrived early and sat in the small bar. The plasma TV was a plus. The had no Bud Light, no Absolut vodka, no olives for the martini's. However everyone was extremely eager to please. Upstairs at the table we had a great view of the Baltimore skyline. They did not have the sauvignon blanc listed on the menu and the chardonnay was available only by the glass ($8). The merlot was available by the bottle. At the bar we were told they did not have any tonic. Upstairs the waitress said they did and miraculously we got gin and tonics. Mona our waitress was very good. We got off to a slow start but she kept up very well after that. Most of the food came out at room temperature. I guess it sat until all the dishes were ready to come out. The linguine demar, their signature dish, was a spicy in a thick cream sauce. I would have preferred a thinner sauce. the 8 shrimp were overcooked and dry. the jamaican jerk shrimp, which seemed to come out cooler than the other dishes, was a ring of medium shrimp around a mound of spicy rice. The shrimp had been grilled and were also dry. The red snapper was lightly breaded and served with just the right amount of sauce that was in the linguine demar. This dish was excellent. It was ordered by someone who wanted a separate check, which mona agreed to, a plus. His food came out hot and prepared excellently. The salads were small amounts of iceberg lettuce and a tomoato wedge. All dressings were served on the side. No deserts were ordered. The tip is added to the bill, even for the single diner. With drinks and tip, the check came to $40 each. Not bad. If you like spicy food, I would suggest trying this spot. I think it the food would have been better had we not been such a large group.
2	neg	dev	It was ok. The food was average and the service was pretty good. Nothing spactacular.
1	neg	dev	Food was expensive for such a greasy spoon restaurant. We were told this was a popular local hang out. If it is, the locals love real dives. The dining room was gaudy, LOUD MUSIC which we had to ask 3 times to be turned down so we could hear ourselves talking, the food was so-so (exception - excellent chef salad) and the service was OK. We'd never go back or tell our friends to go there. They have a huge sign advertising a 99cent breakfast special which we inquired about. Once you add a few extras for a decent breakfast, it will cost $7 or more. WATCH OUT FOR HIDDEN UNADVERTISED COSTS. We were dinged for extras they did not tell us about and told us it was not negotiable. We told them our choice to patronize them was also not negotiable. We won't be back EVER. P.S. Coincidentally, we saw in the local news after we were there that this restaurant had just been convicted in court of fire code violations and fined $10,000. We were not suprised after eating our greasy food to read that the infraction was for a build up of grease on their deep fryers, they were ordered to close the kitchen until it was cleaned.
1	neg	dev	"The ABSOLUTE WORST so called ""STEAKHOUSE"" I have ever been to!!! The swill that they served was not fit to eat!! the house special 20 oz Porterhouse was not a ""FRESH USDA certified Porterhouse"" but a thawed on the grill 10 or 12 oz T-Bone, over cooked and drizzled in the most god awful Garlic/marinade to attempt to cover-up the stench of the over-the-hill hunk of flesh. ---DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY or YOUR STOMACH!!"
2	neg	dev	Hi, It was nice, but boring.
1	neg	dev	I use to having a lanch at this place for a couple of months. My average lunch price was $15. And usually leave at least 25% tips. Service was always very very slow (yet they are usually empty at lunch time), my big tips never made a difference, and waitress (I guess owner's wife) never seems to be able to memorize my preferences... Fish is also not always fresh and they are constantly out of this or that. Well, it was the only japanese food around so I kept coming and just not paying attention to bad things... Guess what, it got worse. One day during lunch some boy waited on me, and it took him 20 minutes and 2 reminders to start me with a tee. I was reading the book, and not in a hurry, so I just watched my watch and didn't show any emotions... I finally had to ask chief (I guess owner) for a tee... Again, I was polite and calm. Next day chief told me (when no customers were around) that the waiter boy was his son and he is not appreciate me treating him like that. I.e. asking for a cup of tee 2 times(!) in 20 minutes (I checked my watch). And that tee if free and is his personal favor to customers! And that I should go somewhere else becuse he don't like me. I was stunned by such a reaction for an asking for a tee... After being a very good customer, paying expensive prices, going there for 2 months and paying big tips for bad service (how stupid of me)... Now I understand why they usually almoust empty... See for yourself if you want to experince service to remember (in a bad way) and high prices for average food. I personally hope this business won't last long
2	neg	dev	Seated at a table facing kitchen door. Four other tables were vacant nearby. Was not asked if table was satisfactory. Arrived at 5:00 and few had arrived.
1	neg	dev	First when you go inside you feel that you go to a funeral house then you go to the table and you sit on patio chairs! I have been in many great steakhouse( Bone's, Charly's, Shula's, Smith & Wollensky and many more) the last thing in this world that seems as a steakhouse is Bern's.
1	neg	dev	"Seated as requested in a booth. Asked for Kids menu for 4-year old granddaughter. Waitress advised it was on the regular menu. I asked if they had crayons or picture books for the kids. Answer was NO. Wife asked if catfish was filets (plural) and could it be prepared crispy. Answer was yes an if it is not crispy, we can throw it back in there?? Salads were fair at best, waitress did not bring rolls and we could not find her. We asked the bus boy to find her. He could not so he went and got us some rolls. The catfish arrived as one huge filet, very greasy, not done in the center. My wife could not eat it so I traded her my chicken and I could not eat the catfish either. The 4-year old ordered steak tips and there was NO flavor at all. We informed the waitress that the fish was not good and not what she said it was. She asked if we wanted ""something else"". We were finished eating (except the catfish was not eaten) when the offer came. The manager never came to the table and we were charged full price for the catfish we did not eat. The only thing I enjoyed was the rolls although they were difficult to come by and we had finished the salads."
3	neg	dev	As tourists in this capitol city we found it surprising that there were very few restaurants open for dinner. I guess their main business is lunchtime. this was one of the few choices available. the service was excellent and atmosphere very nice but, the food itself, the reason for going, was just 50 percent. my husband ordered a Kansas city strip steak that he enjoyed, I should hope so at $26.95. my Scott's seafood saute sounded good with shrimp, clams, scallops, and crab sauteed and served over linguine but the seafood was overcooked and chewy, the shrimp especially were curled up and dried out which I pointed out to the waitress (although how it even got out of the kitchen or out of her hands that way I don't know). she immediately went back to the kitchen and in a few minutes came back with freshly cooked shrimp which were very good but why not the 1st time? the sauce itself was pretty bland and at $18.95 I was just not overjoyed with it. also I ordered a glass of wine for $16 that i know goes for about $8 a bottle and got barely 1/2 a glass. would I try this place again? maybe ,but I'll try somewhere else first and be sure to order steak the next time.
1	neg	dev	The Asian hostess was extremely rude and inhospitable. There were chopsticks on the table which clearly shows that the owner of the restaurant does not know Thai cuisine as much as they would like people to think. There was also Japanese plates on the table. This restaurant is not a Thai restaurant and should not have the word Thai in it name.
1	neg	dev	I would like to think that if you were to go out for dinner that you would not be insulted by the server. We had a rude server who insulted us from the first minute we walked in. We were asked to move from the front door and then asked to move from by the bar. The restaurant was busy but the way we were talked to was what we took offence to. We received our drinks, 20 minutes after we ordered them. We asked the server what was taking so long and she snapped at us, telling us that she was busy and that was the way Bin does things around here. We ordered a few tapas. Should have been called CRAPAS. The food took forever and came in 30 min intervals. The blonde cook was angry and was drinking on the job!!!! Should have put more effort into the food instead of into his drinking. They screwed up our order twice and then managed to charge us for things that we did not even eat. We were told that Bin was good - we would have to say that Bin is S...! What a crime...don't eat here. Food is a rip off and service was horrible. I phoned to complain but doubt if they will do anything about it. There is a better restaurant one block down...we will go there from now on!!!
3	neg	dev	A quick service bistro that is fine for a quick lunch. Staff is friendly but the feng shui is off. This and the lack of menu signs and prices creates confushions for the customers.
1	neg	dev	There are literally thousand of restaurants in San Francisco and I have to say that Stinking Rose is one of the worsts in the city. We are not impressed with the food and the service. I am sorry to say but this is truly a place for tourists only because once you have tried it, you will not go back again. The only attractive of the restaurant is it names because if you are a garlic lover like me, you think you will be satisfied with the intensive smell and the favor of the garlic. We ordered their famous Garlic chicken, Garlic mussels and a pizza. Let me tell you, you will be truthly disappointed because the favor of the food is very bland. The presentation is not spectacular. The seating is uncomfortabe, the table is very small and the waiter spilled on me. They also give you small portion of the food for the price that you pay.
2	neg	dev	I'll keep this short since the experience would have been better if i did not have to witness the owner making a fool of himself at the bar. Food was good but if I wanted to watch the owner/chef dance on the bar and see his blonde bimbo girl friend make out with some other chick I would have gone to the Cecil. Could have been good but the owner is an idiot!!!!
3	neg	dev	A very nice italian restaurant where families as well as dates will feel special.
2	neg	dev	Diners who come to this location expecting to see the Cici's represented in television ads will be sorely disappointed. Slightly seedy, and overcrowded with video arcade games and gumball machines that attract families with young children allowed to run amuck, this franchise is housed in a storefront in the mostly deserted end of a strip mall just off U.S. 19. The concept is great - all-you-can-eat pizza, pasta, salad, and dessert for the incredibly low price of $3.99. But after a change in management in early 2005, quality and service began to slide, and our most recent visit convinced us not to return again. Although all the salad bar extras - cherry tomatoes, black olives, cucumber slices, and the like - were fresh, the greens themselves were brown and wilted. One pasta was barely cooked, the other boiled to mush. The marinara sauce was bland but at least it was hot; the Alfredo sauce was ice cold. Pizzas were either underbaked or burnt. There wasn't much variety in the selections offered - a preponderance of peopperoni prevailed - and although we were told we could have a pie prepared to order, our selection still hadn't been made 30 minutes after our arrival. Unfortunately, when it finally made it to the table, it wasn't what we had ordered. The place looked and felt less than clean, possibly because dirty tables remained unbussed long after their occupants had departed. Noise level is a problem here when the place is crowded, and a blurry, widescreen TV set on a cable news channel that nobody seemed to be watching simply added to the din. The many negatives make the price tag less of the bargain it was when this place was operated in a more professional, caring manner. Get your Cici's fix at another location, because this one has lost its appeal.
3	neg	dev	A darkly lit steak house located directly off Interstate 55. The wine list is on the high end with no selection under $32. Meat highlights the menu and is grilled to perfection. All sides are served ala carte but are large enough to share. A fish of the day is offered but beef is the speciality here.
1	neg	dev	This used to be a great, family type restaurant but given the recent demographic changes in Lancaster, owernship decided they needed to make the place more upscale, which included going from cooks to bringing in chef's from some Bflo restaurants. They remodeled, prices went up and the food got worse. We used to get a couple Friday's month for years but we recently stopped going. It was all about atmosphere and large helpings of great inexpensive food. Like everything else in Lancaster, this place is trying to cater to a high clientele, despite brisk business and a constant line for tables.
2	neg	dev	This dining experience fell quite short of it`s expectations. Portions were very small. The cuban bean soup tasted like the canned lentil soup I ate as a child. Minus the chopped hot dogs.And what the hell was I thinking when I ordered an inside out ravioli...Noone was happy with their meal.........Should have gone to painters for the for the blackened steak salad and Shrimp rocco.
2	neg	dev	ordered at 1999 vintage, recieved a 2000, they did not offer to change the wine, even after we said we were displeased with the wine. Our appetizer was wrong, they fixed that mistake.
1	neg	dev	waitress has poor attitude, never cleared the plates, never refilled the drinks, was never around. whenever we needed service, we had to asked another waiter. advertisement said All You Can Eat Buffet, but each guess only could eat 1/2 of a small lobster which was all you can get before. I'm very disappointed with this restaurant and I will never return again or refer this restaurant to any one else.
1	neg	dev	Terrible, for an eatery in the great state of TEXAS!!!
1	neg	dev	Steak was well overcooked, crab legs were well under the specified weight advertised in the menu. The only consolation offered by the manager, after ruining my birthday dinner was to not pay for the meal.
1	neg	dev	Terrible service. Sushi chef taking shots of sake and pounding beers in between making rolls. Waited forever for half of order. Other half came 45 minutes later but declined to accept because of delay. Don't visit.
2	neg	dev	"The East Buffet offers a nice atmosphere,but not much else. They includer a large variety of dishes on their buffet,but most of the offerings lacked flavor and were bland. We appreciate the subtleties of conservative use of seasoning so as not to overpower the natural tastes of a dish,but here this was taken to extreme. It is true that one can add seasonings to a dish to adjust it's flavoring to suit one's personal tastes,but some seasonings must be used in the preparation of the dish so as to ""meld and marry"" with it's flavor attributes during the cooking process. At East Buffet little,if any,seasoning was added in the cooking process. We would recommend that those seeking a good Chinese buffet meal visit the China Buffet which is located in the next parking lot. Their food is much more flavorful and significantly less expensive as well!"
2	neg	dev	Just not that great. Not bad, but nothing sticks out. They do have pretty good specials and it's really worth it if you can hit a buffet, but other than that, the food's nothing to go out of your way for.
1	neg	dev	I ate brunch at this restaurant on Christmas 2002 morning. I ate a Denver omelet with a small cup of salsa, some wheat toast and 1 1/2 cups of coffee. Later in the day(about four hours after eating) I became very ill - vomiting, severe stomach/colon cramps and diarreah. I suspect that I either got food poisoning from the omelete or salsa or the cleaner used to clean the coffee pots wasn't properly rinsed out before the coffee pot was filled with coffee. The pain/symptoms were quite severe and lasted for several days. I don't believe it was the flu as I have had a flu shot - feel that it was definitely caused by the breakfast I had eaten. Thank you! Jim
1	neg	dev	The service was so bad -- rude and arrogant -- that we didn't even stay to order food. This restaurant thinks that it doesn't matter how they treat people.
2	neg	dev	Samba was one of my favorite place for Sunday Brunch. Up until today, we arrived around 3:00 like every other Sunday. The Hostess greated us with a smile and then asked us to wait, we didn't understand why because we saw plenty of open tables. We waited for about 10 minutes, then we got seated. The server greated us 10 minutes later and explain that it was dinner. We asked why if we always arrived at that time, plus the buffet had brunch items. When we left we told the hostess who apoligize and called the manager. The manager didn't even say sorry insted she argued with us and called the server. Who argued more with us. I felt that the precence of a GM or a more prepare manager was needed. To solve this issue I left my phone # with the hostess so that the manager could call me back.
1	neg	dev	Our seafood (salmon & halibut)were both served at unsafe food temperatures. Both fish dishes were served cold and barely cooked. When we told the waitress the OWNER came over to our table and made very crude remarks. This woman has no clue how to treat customers! We will never return to this restaurant again. I wouild advise anyone and everyone to STAY AWAY!! The owners do not seem to care that their food is served raw and uncooked.
2	neg	dev	Service real bad!!! Waiters were not frindly it all, lacking smiles, may be they do not know how. Atmosphere kind of dry, restaurant lay out super plain.
3	neg	dev	Part of the well known national chain that serves average food. If you are staying near the Orlando airport, this is a short and easy drive. The bartenders make it worth the average food.
3	neg	dev	Friendly and knowledgeable wait staff provided for an great lunch. Located over looking marshes in Mt. Pleasent. Large salads and appitiz. are enough for food for any lunch.
1	neg	dev	Everything is great, the burger is delicous, (if you are not allergic to bleu cheese). The reason I would not go back is that the server was very rude to me repeatedly. I have been there several times, and the service seems to get worse... so, good bye f.o. there are other good burgers, I am sure....: (
2	neg	dev	Not good at all.
1	neg	dev	"Simply Put: Racist attitudes towards minorities. The Incident: My group of 12 consisted obviously of minorities. We arrived at 7:50 PM on a Saturday night. A party of 16, multiple parties of 8, and everyone else were seated first before we were even considered (they all arrived after us). At 10:00 PM I was finally able to speak with the manager. (There was only one other party waiting at the restaurant waiting). Alan told me quite frankly: ""you were told to wait 2 hours and we still need you to wait"" and basically walked away. No apologies, no nothing! If everyone at the Joe's Crabshack was made to wait equally or if the staff admitted to a scheduling error on their part, I wouldn't be as disgusted with their establishment as I am now. I would never even consider dining there again. For a full recap of my incident please visit http://www.geocities.com/supersizebri Corporate Office Action: They called me and apologized. They even offered to send ""incentives"" for damage control. I respectfully declined. My mission is to tell everyone about their poor corporate mentality and the types of belittling mgmt they hire in Long Beach. Review submitted by: Brian Ki"
1	neg	dev	Friends said Todai was good. Maybe it is, with the exeption of San Jose's Eastridge Mall location. I dined alone and they boxed me in with two families. The only fish entree was grilled salmon which was plain and over-cooked. NO LOBSTER. My meal was 1 plate of 2 inari, shrimp, chicken teriyaki, steamed rice, miso soup for the low price of $26.00. If cramped dining, mediocre food, and inflated pricing is what you're looking for look no further! And you'd think they could afford real cocktail sauce instead of ketchup. 26 reasons why I wont be back.
1	neg	dev	I concur with the majority here. This place sucks, as does the service and food. I ordered fajitas, and the tortillas were hard as rocks. I asked the waitress to exchange them, but she said that they were supposed to be like that. Uh, I don't think so. I also had to ask twice to get my guacamole. What the hell is up with the harboring of guacamole? I didn't think twice about it until I read the reviews here where they did the same thing to other people. This place is a giant hole, go somewhere else. There's another Mexican grill around the corner, it's bound to be better than this dump.
3	neg	dev	The Asgard was overall a good experience. We had a large party and the waiter was both patient and effiecient, although the refills on drinks were a bit lax. I had the mushroom ravioli and although it was tasty, I could not reconcile the $13.99 I paid for the small portion of food. I am glad that I had some of a friends Cajun Kettle Chips (which were really good) that helped fill me up, because I could have eaten two portions of the ravioli. My boyfriend ordered the steak sandwich, which was also disappointing. It was advertised as a sirloin strip, but it seemed more like a steak-um with cheese. The atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and cozy, but the food/value would make me not return for more than drinks at the bar with friends.
1	neg	dev	I have eaten there many times in the past and was pleased, but this time it was possibly the worst meal I have ever had. Restaurant had an overal grungy appearance Dishes and glasses are chipped, scratched and dirty looking. Food was obviously re-heated and had no flavor. I returned my meal to the server and he didn't seemed surprised to be getting it back. I would not suggest this place to anyone. We ate at the Farmhouse (they have 2 dining areas- I am not sure what they call the other one). I ordered the chicken pot pie, which I returned and the waiter removed from the bill. It was warm, but had a congealed consistency and the crust was very rubbery. Just an all around unpleasant looking and tasting item. Food should look good, smell good, taste good and even feel good in your mouth - this did none of those things. My husband ordered the prime rib - gray in color and sitting in a puddle of what looked like water. His dinner came with a little cup of what I guess was suppose to be aus jus, but honestly was clear grease with some brown globs in the bottom. It did not smell good either. He did eat about 1/2 of what I would term as the edible part of the piece he was served. The vegetable soup was the only item that was good - tasted like it always has. As for the restaurant's atmosphere, it was basically grungy. The table had not been wiped off and there were crumbs and glass rings visible. The clear drinking glasses are so scratched and worn they have a beige color to them and the dishes are not in much better shape - lots of spidery cracks and chips.
1	neg	dev	Franco's has no ambiance and the food is pitiful. It looked and tasted like a can of tomatoes dumped over some packaged pasta. While waiting for the bill the manager interrogated me about sending the food back. Then, as we're sitting there still waiting on our bill, an irate Italian man starts yelling at me and then storms off. Franco's Italian Caffe is an Italian Carrow's; the food and atmosphere are equally bland. The great thing about Carrow's, however, is that it doesn't pretend to be Ruth's Chris and they don't yell at you if you send the food back!
2	neg	dev	Expensive pretending-to-be-classy place. We found lots of hair in food. The manager refused to apologize or replace the food. We left angry and fuming.
2	neg	dev	This restaraunt was recommended. So, I thought my husband and I would give it a try. We took a friend along with us. Upon arriving the outside of the building was nice, the atomosphere was very nice. I thought ok this is going to be good. When I looked at the buffet I was disappointed. For the price there should be more to choose from. But, I was still optomistic. When I tried the food, it was disgusting. You could actually see the grease settleing on the food. And we were early for dinner. For a building of that size, you would have thought the buffet area could have been spread out more. Instead of all the tables being crammed together in a little room. Also, we sit the the smoking area. The outside door had been propped open. I suppose so the flies could come eat with us. There were staff members continuously coming in and out of the other emergency door. Just over all not a pleasant experience. When we decided to leave. At 7:00. I ask our waitress for the check. At 7:15, still no check. At 7:20, I had to actually get up and go tell someone that I would like our check please. At 7:30, we were fianally given our check. I think I expect more for $60.(2 people)
2	neg	dev	Leave this place to the tourists - the ones you don't know! Let me give a little advice to the kitchen: if your menu features garlic, then don't pass old, reheated roasted garlic onto your customers! It's not like garlic breaks the overhead!
1	neg	dev	WE had a child with us & we we never offered a child menu--so we ordered off the regular menu. OUr server was horrible & did not check on us for refills & I had to ask for something for my child to coler on & thats when we found out they had a childs menu. The server was slow & the food was not good at all. When we left we were not told anything..like thankyou please come again, or how was the food......we will never return & we wil never recommend anybody to that resturant.
2	neg	dev	Way overpriced and staff was very eletist and snobby
2	neg	dev	"This is a very small restraunt and would be very charming but the night we were there a party of 6 in another room was acting like they were in a sports bar or at a tailgate party. It was impossible to talk and despite the repeated complaints of many of the tables to the waiters, management failed to manage their own restaurant. Guests were leaving as quickly as they could finish. The food was excellant but our waiter was very slow to greet us and to take our order. He wouldn't even move around the table to be able to hear the orders so we just ended up pointing at the menu. I have also never had the tip added to the bill for such a small party - I guess they were worried about the ""atmosphere's"" effect on the size of gratuity. I've eaten here before and love the food but never again."
3	neg	dev	Really cool place down by the river. Cajun fries with every order...love that! Other than that, it's regular pub food, but a little better.
3	neg	dev	Another Italian resturant, but this one leans more towards an Americanized Italian. Still, really good food and sandwhiches.
3	neg	dev	Typical of the large chains, this unit is very loud, loaded with families, and the menu starts out with large drinks and fried appitizers. The wait staff was friendly and helpfull but the food quality needs to be improved. They serve thier ribs with a variety of BBQ sauce flavors.
3	neg	dev	"Yoder's Restaurant and Buffet is attached to Yoder's Farm Market in New Holland,Pennsylvania. While their buffet offerings were perfectly edible, they did have that mass-produced quality that one would not expect from a restaurant that promises ""home-style"" cooking. The only item on their buffet that stood out as not being mass-produced was their stuffed chicken breast. It did seem to be like what one would expect from their Grandmother's kitchen. They did have an excellent dessert selection which even included some low-sugar items."
1	neg	dev	Bad Service bad selection of food. Not tasty at all.
1	neg	dev	Not only did everything cost so much, when the food came out to your table, it looked like my fish could had eaten it; the portion was so small...I would never return
1	neg	dev	"Hands down this is the most poorly run Red Robin we have ever been to. On a scale of 1 to 10 on how clean it is, I put it at around 4 or 5 (in other words, the health department should consider a visit). Staff: What staff? While my wife and I try to eat at a place 3 or 4 times before really forming an opinion, there have been two occasions when we sat for anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes, without even a ""someone will be with your"" or ""have you been helped"" from any of the staff. The servers clearly would rather be somewhere other than work. The managers don't appear to exist. And the food is substantially poor in quality and porportion. My wife and I have had many pleasant experiences at Red Robins across the US, but this one seems to be off in its own little world. If you are in the Woodbridge area, and want to experience what Red Robin should really be like, go to the Red Robin in Fairfax, it is on the opposite end of the scale, and one of the best."
1	neg	dev	"As soon as we arrived we were seated, well the place was half empty. The owner or manager took us to our table and hung our coats for us. A waiter came with a doggy bag and put it on our table; we had not even gotten our menus; it gets better he screamed to the bus boy, who was getting ready to serve us our water, ""this glass is dirty please change it"". We ordered our wine as well as our appetizers and our meal. One of our wine glasses was dirty, a diferent waiter took the glass threw the wine out and our waiter returned to the table with an empty glass of wine. It gets better, when the appetizers arrived to the table the waiter threw the appetizers on our plates. As we are eating fruit flies start coming out of the hot antipasto. When we make the comment to our waiter he comes back "" I can change you to another table, we have been having this problem in this area for over 2 weeks."" We decide to leave, the owner/manager sent a lady to give us our coats, he dosen't even come to our table to appologize or even to talk to us as we are leaving he is seated at the bar and all he has to say is "" sorry for that"" he didn't even get up. We would of stayed to have the rest of our meal, if we had not been treated so poorly."
1	neg	dev	Have been there several times, and WILL NOT RETURN AGAIN. Food has declined, but service and management concerns about the service/food are non-esistent! We had to send back 3 dinners, 25 minutes later, 1 returned, and we were told that that they were out of the other 2 (prime rib -- it's a STEAKHOUSE!) Then offered us any steak for the prime rib. Finally got those, then were charged for the full meal!! (Even though the prime rib dinners were more than the replacement dinners!) Manager offered us $15 off the bill (not even the price of one of the prime rib dinners). Add us to the list of those who WILL NOT GO BACK and will let our friends know also!!
2	neg	dev	Great decor. Mediocre to bad service that does not match the prices. Food was well conceived but poorly executed - the 13$ half pound of tofu, for instance, comes by itself on a plate with only a tiny bit of sauce. Restaurant suffers from typical Ithaca problem: either cheap with tons of bad food, or expensive with only a little bid of not so bad food. Seems lilke a great place for cocktails, though.
2	neg	dev	Nothing special. Cold meat sandwiches and pizza. There's so many places like this in Peoria it's hard to stand out.
1	neg	dev	"We were looking for a romantic dinner for our 10th wedding anniversary and the reviews on Citysearch of Mary Elaine's were right on track. However, the experience was far from our expectations. The restaurant was stogy and formal, not softly romantic. Seating was uncomfortable, and the service was sorely lacking. The 20 minute wait to see a menu should have been our first clue to the evening to come. Since I am pregnant, my husband and I elected to forgo wine with our meal. My single glass of warm water had to be nursed as I was afraid to finish it for fear of not getting any more. The reviews had stated we could expect to pay $41 and up per meal. However, the menu didn't have prices on it. There was a line that mentioned the ""3 course tastings"" listed carried an $85 surcharge. We figured that was the price of each meal. The special was a rib eye steak, and the waiter mentioned a $75 surcharge for that meal. The steak turned out to be an ""entree to be shared by two"". Our thought was now that this would be closer to the price we had expected. The steak was no larger than anything you'd cook on your own barbeque, and came to us over done. To top it off, when they split the steak into the two portions, it had been sliced with the grain, creating a very tough texture. The scalloped potatoes served with it had literally no flavor. (The chef could use an introduction to an onion!) This was a very special occasion for us, so I elected not to ruin it by complaining. The bill finally arrived, and we found we had suffered in silence thru a whopping $318. On the drive home, I was slowly becoming nauseated, which a few hours later became the world most expensive dysentery! Having dined at the Different Pointe of View restaurant on a few occasions, I must implore anyone considering spending their special occasion at Mary Elaine's to go to the Pointe instead. The atmosphere is every bit as formal, the view is spectacular, the service and food quality is a hundred times better, and the price is a third of what you'll spend at Mary Elaine's! PS- I left a message for the manager, but have yet to receive a return call!"
1	neg	dev	When you first walk in to the restaurant you get a really weird smell that comes from the kitchen, some say it smells like bleach, others say it smells kinda moldy, but the smell is not what is gonna make you angry for going to this place. The service by far, has had the worst waiters and waitresses that work for them, they don't care about the customers and are very forgetful, and they don't even apologize! I have been in there when it would happen to be slow, and still I got horrible service. Now on to the food quality, even if you could call it food. It starts off by coming almost an hour after we order, so by the time you get it at your table, its too cold to even eat it. The portions are ridiculous, I don't think a bird could fill up on there table scraps. The whole experience has always been horrible and unsatisfying, I don't recommend wasting your breath looking at the menu, just keep walking by...
1	neg	dev	I ate there with my sister Parthena (who also sumitted a review) several times. Thankfully, I never had to pay. I live within walking distance of the place and it is not worth the drive. Lamotte's has an unfounded reputation for seafood. You could catch a 3 eyed carp out of the Codorus that tastes better. Service is typical of PA establishments, wholely mediocre. Do not go there unless you are a deep pocketed masochist.
2	neg	dev	"Maybe too ""Palo Alto"" for us? Very much overpriced!!!! Only the wine will remain as special. And with the price tag ($10 for a 11oz pichet) that's the least we could expect. All the rest was really deceiving, as our expectations were pretty high based on the previous reviews posted...."
1	neg	dev	We waited 35 minutes before our waitress appeared at our order to take our order. We waited another 30 minutes for our food to appear. The waitress shouted who had the turkey? who had the... If we didn't automatically answer she was easily agitated. Hey is it our fault we forgot, 30 minutes is a long time to wait for a sandwich and bowl of soup. When our bills arrived, they were incorrect. We spent another 10 minutes straightening them out at the cash register. Some bills were double the amount, some were charged incorrectly, such as charging for a regular size drink when we ordered a small. We were treated as if it was our fault because we were a large group. The commercials look good but I will eat out of a paper wrapped before I visit this place again!
1	neg	dev	This is absolutely horrible. We went to this restaurant thinking it was a different one. The sign on the building was the sign for a restaurant that had closed. Lighthouse opened and did not change the sign. Very expensive for horrible food. Limited selection on the buffet. Lobster was tough and stringy. They rarely had enough available. Other selections had been on the buffet table for a long time. NEVER, NEVER go to this restaurant. There are good seafood buffets in Orlando (Boston Lobster Feast) but Lighthouse is worthless.
1	neg	dev	We were served moldy bread, and then when confronting the staff about it, the response was very distasteful.
1	neg	dev	This restaurant placed an advertisement in the homeowner's coupons distributed by Merchant & Publisher of Long Island. The coupon was distributed with Free Dinner/Lunch Entree-no holidays. I chose this place due to the coupon and had a very horrible experience. 1. I arrived at 2:45pm and was given a dinner menu, when the waiter came I asked for the lunch menu. He left to get place setting for the table and was gone for approx 5 min, when he came back, I asked for the lunch menu and was told that lunch stopped serving at 3:00pm. I explained to him that it was 2:50pm and not 3:00pm and that I wanted to be served from the lunch menu. He refused. 2. My other party group 3(excluding myself) decided to go ahead an order from the dinner menu. I presented the coupon to the waiter on the free dinner entree when you buy one of equal value. He said he will take at the end of the meal. He then came back to the table and told us that the manager says that today was a holiday. the day was Tues 12/31/02. We explained that the holiday is tomorrow New Years Day 1/1/03, however, he refused to take the coupon. the party did continue to eat since they had already started. The bottom line is that THIS RESTUARANT USED THE COUPON TO LURE PATRONS TO THE RESTAURANT AND CHANGE RULES IN MID STREAM. ALL OF THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS BEHAVIOR. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY RESTAURANTS THROUGHOUT THE US AND INTL, ESPECIALLY SINCE I TRAVEL HEAVILY FOR MY JOB, AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO INSULTED IN MY LIFE. PLEASE ADVERTISE THIS ON THE SITE SO OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOT PLACED IN THIS DILEMMA. IF I WAS ALONE AND NOT HAVE COMPANY WITH ME, I WOULD HAVE WALKED OUT AND LEFT HIS FOOD SITTING ON THE TABLE.
2	neg	dev	I was very disappointed with our visit this past weekend. I frequently visit Lickerish and this evening decided to bring my boyfriend here for dinner. I ordered the Kobe beef appetizer, the dish that I always order. On this occasion the dish was not anywhere close to the quality that I am use to. The flavours were not the same and the beef was over cooked. I noticed that the menu was different. My boyfriend tried the baked brie. It use to come on a small plate but on this occasion, came on this over-sized square plate. While the brie was good, the larger plate gave us the impression that the dish was a rip-off. The martinis were good but our entrees were not the same as what I have had before. I was very surprised at the lack of quality as I usually rave about the food. We asked the server what was wrong with the kitchen and she told us that their original chef was no longer with them. I would have to say that it showed. We were both very disappointed with the food, from everything from the quality to the length of time it took us to get our food. It really is too bad that they changed their chef. After eating here this past weekend, I think that it was our last.
2	neg	dev	Noisy. Won't take reservations, even for larger parties, they say. Long waits. The staff has no clue as to how long the wait will take. Bad wine. Bad food. Cheap stuff thrown together for the masses. Probably great for a kid's birthday.
2	neg	dev	"This place is really bad. I make better pizza at home on English muffins. Acidy and simple tomato sauce with a sour aftertaste. Bland and ordinary crust - In fact the same goes for all the toppings on the ""New York style"" pizza I ordered. Bland pepperoni, sausage and cheese. Lobster bisque soup seemed canned with all the preservatives and chemicals that go with that process. I can only imagine it comes in 5 gallon cans from the corporate warehouse. Salad was ok, but would have been better if the recipe they use for red wine vinaigrette had more imagination than just red wine vinegar and oil. I don't think they even added salt and pepper to it. Pizza is among my favorite things to eat, and I've had pizza from all over the country and usually never leave disappointed. Some pizza is better than others, and some are really superb. This was a very rare experience where I left confused and surprised - I really was expecting it to be better than little Caesars."
2	neg	dev	Good inexpensive Italian food. The loud and very casual atmosphere seemed a little out of place in the nice decor. The service was lacking a bit. The bottle of wine I ordered was unceremoniously place on the table with the cork pulled half way out for me. I may return for family lunch but there is little romance here for a date.
3	neg	dev	Small little cafe where everyone knows everyone else. I've never gotten my meal so fast.....anywhere! The price is right and the food is alright
3	neg	dev	"A travel guide book recommended this spot. The night I visited, the town of Estes Park had a power outage, so the staff and owners were extremely helpful and pleasant to accommodate clients; encouraging us to wait for the power to return. Kudos to them for being so kind. I found the chips and salsa ""mediocre"", the chicken burrito I ordered was ""ok"", but nothing to scream at, plus that entree did not include any other items (like rice &/or beans). The margarita (frozen) tasted like it was a pre-mixed version. Overall, I was disappointed with the food, given the review in the guide book. But again, staff was very friendly, service was quick, the place was clean and brightly decorated. perhaps the food was a reflection of the recent power outage. Bon Appetite!"
3	neg	dev	The best thing about this Quizno's is that it's downtown. There's not a whole lot of choices downtown....especially for something fast.
2	neg	dev	Very disappointing! Had been here for lunch and the Grilled Tuna was great! Had a birthday boy who was a seafood lover and decided to return. Reservations were honored at 8:45pm on Saturday, the promised time. The restaurant didn't appear to be overly busy. Our waitress took at least 10 minutes to get a drink order. We waited the next ten minutes for 2 coffees and 2 cokes. She was obviously inconvenienced and insulted that we couldn't hear what she was saying about her scripted suggestions. She ignored all attempts to understand her and she mumbled on! After finishing her speech we begged to put in our appetizer and salad orders. With a surgeons skill we split up the small slice of butter and spread it on the crunchy, warm bread. Looks were deceiving; it tasted like a poor quality frozen par baked product. The appetizers arrived 30 minutes after being seated. The salad was typical but the poppy seed dressing was good. The lobster bisque was lacking in taste and absent of lobster. Some crunchy things lay at the bottom of the cup. They had a slight fish taste but it was a mystery from what kind of animal it had originated. The clams were also bland but they were the Little Necks promised. We have had to ask for anything needed at this point. There wasn't any attempt to actually provide service it was only to appease us our requests and that wasn't performed very enthusiastically or promptly. They did manage to clear plates after the appetizers, but they had a lot of time. Our neighbors were finishing desserts as the stop watch was halted at 30 minutes, after appetizer presentation. The entrees were plopped in front of us with much less grace then a good greasy spoon. The dinners were not provided any attention in the garnish department. The Strip steaks were tasty once you hacked through the gristle and were cooked to the requested doneness. The two Main lobster dinners were dry and the heat lamps seemed to succeed in keeping them a bit warmer then room temperature. The baked potatoes provided were naked of the butter, sour cream and chives promised. There was an attempt at putting some of these items on the potatoes. We were curious what utensil was required to portion that small of an amount. To hungry to complain and without anyone to complain, we chopped through the dry, hard bakers. The wimpy asparagus and green beans provided a contrast.. Luckily good company makes a dining experience like this tolerable. We had already made a night out of it, so we decided to get the birthday boy some dessert. They did provide a complementary Shark Fin dessert. HUGE! The four of us shared it and we still had to work at finishing it. The work was not only in appetite but make sure you keep your steak knife. This frozen mountain with its caramel and peanut butter, turns to a form as strong as concrete when frozen. We utilized team effort, as two of us held the plate and two of us attempted to saw through with the spoons provided. We give them thumbs up on the Shark Fin. Our waitress blossomed in front of our eyes as she became very friendly as she presented the bill. We walked out the door after spending a two hours and fifteen minutes with great friends. Business must be good because not one person was interested how anything was or if we would be back. There is a cute little patio next door that was playing some nice jazz. We will eat dinner somewhere else and stop for the jazz next time.
3	neg	dev	Evening started great with good service and the first dishes served were great. However as the evening progressed, so the food started going downhill. The service fluctuated between attentive and non-existant. The overall experience was disappointing mainly because i) The mussels were awful(perhaps bordering on being off) ii)The paella was disguisting-tasteless,mushy and NOTHING remotely resembling paella. It was a 'want to be' risotto with some boiled seafood ontop of it iii)A tot of 'house' whisky cost almost half the price of an entire bottle iv)The ffod was served totally erratically with poor thought (potato wedges were served last instead of together with other dishes. So in summary, even though some dishes were delicious (prawns, mushrooms) others were awful. Even though we did bring these comments to the attention of our server and the chef, our comments seemed to fall on deaf ears. The evening turned out to be very expensive.
3	neg	dev	What can you say about a fast food Italian place? It's not true Italian food...not even the best American/Italian, but if you want Italian fast, this is it.
3	neg	dev	I ENJOYED LUNCH AT THIS HOTEL RESTAURANT, WITH A VERY RELAXED, EASY GOING ATMOSPHERE. SERVICE WAS FAST, FOOD WAS HOT. I ORDERED CHICKEN ENCHILADAS SERVED WITH RICE AND BLACK BEANS. VERY TASTY. IF YOU ARE PASSING THROUGH GOLDEN, MIGHT BE WORTH A STOP. BON APETITE!
3	neg	dev	Of all the Japanese restaurants located in Japantown, Izumiya does not stand out as one of the best, although it has potential, service was a little slow and our server forgot one of our ordered items (steamed rice). I consistently order a common Sushi staple at almost every Japanese restaurant that I visit, however Izumiya was unable to fill my request (Salmon Roe with Quail egg). Izumiya offers at best a limited menu, which included fried flounder and some Sushi dishes, I went for the Udon with beef, and the food was average. With so many excellent Japanese restaurants in San Francisco, it will be a while before I venture back to Izumiya again, so many good Sushi restaurants, and so little time!
1	neg	dev	Asked for a table for 6, waited to be called, then had to wait for the sixth chair to be brought after they took us to the table (finally got it myself). Very slow service, waitress tried to scam us on our change. Expensive, small portions.
3	neg	dev	all you can eat, mentality. Diner type food. Nothing wrong with that, but a hug platter of mediocre isn't my idea of fun. Also noisy room- not enough soft surfaces to absorb the sound. Not an occasion spot - lunch on the go would be fine.
1	neg	dev	Service was slow to put it kindly. Prices were extremely high for the quality and quantity. 4 of our party of 8 got our food within a reasonable time, the other 4 , well we had to wait and then inquire and then get the manager over 2 times before we finally got our food 3 minutes after the previous 4 arrived. Our drinks were never checked or refreshed until we finally got up and got them ourselves. The food was exotic game and I think it must have been prepared by an exotic cook also. tough and not very appetizing. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone traveling to Dallas. I don't see how they have been open for the year they have been in business. it's certainly not due to return customers. I recommend McDonalds over this lousy restaurant anyday.
2	neg	dev	The quality of the food is not worth the money they charge. It's a chain for Christ's sake. I could've gone to a superb restaurant for the money we paid. They stuck us in the back room away from the main dining. I, personally, felt like an outcast. Then, our server tricked us into thinking that soup/salad was included with the main entree. Do not be fooled! A bowl of bland minestrone soup will cost you $6. What a rip off!
1	neg	dev	The food had a strange and unpleasant taste. The employees where rude and unclean. The dinning area was filled with smoke from the employees. the tables where also not cleaned.
2	neg	dev	"A multi location seafood restaurant in Columbia, SC. The fish arrives fresh everyday and is of good quality. Unfortunately, everything is down hill from there. The service is very slow and inattentive. Several tables had to get up to get their own napkins, silverware, sugar, etc. The hush puppies are a tasteless oil sponge. The lettuce in the ""garden salad"" is only chopped iceberg served with one crouton. If your hungry in this are there are better options."
1	neg	dev	It took over an hour from the time we sat down to the time our breakfast order came out. People who arrived after us ate, and left, before we even ordered. Coffee and water were slow in coming, and not refilled until the check was brought out. The waitress never checked in to make sure things were o.k. (they weren't, the food was cold), and the manager/owner, apparently, was too busy working in the kitchen to come out and talk to us. We were offered discounts to this and a sister-restaurant, which we declined. Sent an e-mail to the owner detailing the problems we experienced, and received a rude, flaming response back accusing me of whining and having nothing better to do than pick on a small business. Pretty much a forgettable experience and place.
3	neg	dev	The Tin Tin House is a Chinese buffet and Asian barbecue restaurant. In addition to the usual Chinese items they also offer a selection of barbecued items on their buffet including barbecued pork ribs which would have stood out even down South! We were quite impressed with the food and for $5.95 their buffet,which included shrimp and even crawfish, is quite a good deal. Our only complaint was that, when we requested refills on our beverages, the waitress also took the glasses from other patrons at the same time as she took ours. We had no way of knowing if we received back our own glasses! This was somewhat distressing. We would recommend that one try this restaurant while in the Springfield,MA area.
3	neg	dev	Hawaiian Airlines went into bankruptcy after 9/11, and unusually the airline management was removed by the court and replaced by a trustee, while the airline kept on flying. This trustee has some good taste, let me tell you. Traveling from Poipu Beach on Kauai's south shore, Hawaii's most northerly visitor's island. On the way to the mainland I had chosen Hawaiian Airlines, as they had on offer a special front cabin fare. Hawaiian use to operate old DC-10s for its transpacific operation, but these gave way just a few years ago to Boeing 767, albeit from the pre-owned selection of offer from Boeing financing, nonetheless an improvement in interior sound control if not spaciousness. With airline, its fair to say that the distinctions between them must be minimal, as they operate the same equipment, which itself is constrained to the same physical layout. Only a few airlines achieve any distinction in my view. Among them I include, of course, the proverbial Singapore and even Air France. In fact, for me the latter's food and wine make a difference adding to a distinction. To my surprise, Hawaiian's food the day I flew on Flight 02, achieved the same. In the front cabin the good old bankruptcy trustee served a four course repast, appetizer, salad with finally assembly at seat side, main course, and post-prandial confections. The appetizer was an excellent single jumbo, please forgive the contradiction, shrimp. Okay maybe it was a prawn. But the exception started with the salad. Truly fresh quality greens nested generously in a none too dinky airline bowl, as the server finished with the perfect embellishment, the use of Japanese Candied peas. These can be had all over the Hawaiian islands, due to the large now indigenous Japanese population catered to by the supermarkets. I had never thought to put them in a salad, but the trustee in the bankruptcy court had quite originally done so, How many trustees know about Japanese candied peas I wondered as I crunched down, savoring the mix on the palate with the greens and the great dressing on offer, hand ladled by the attendant. So much for great food I thought. I had a choice of main dishes and selected the unidentified fish. The trustee didn't want to commit to a species on the menu. I guess the benefits of law school were not lost on Hawaiians trustee. Nonetheless, the unidentified fish, perhaps unoriginally but thoroughly coated in sesame seeds, was as thick as a respectable steak, properly cooked, a perfect cut of the said unidentified and anonymous fish. My guess the fellow I had hailed from the Ono family. And a savory character to him. One Ball and two strikes, and at the postre, a chocolate mouse, appealing to my prejudice for all things from cocoa beans, this airline was on the bases. So please, come enjoy Poipu Beach and take Hawaiian Airlines when you do, you may find the bankruptcy trustee yet in the kitchen. I hope they keep him/her on permanently.

1	neg	dev	Be warned about Bistro 123 in Vienna, VA. While there are many pleasant French restaurants in the area, this is not one of them. They started by seating us by the kitchen door on an uncrowded evening, and things went downhill from there. My companion's filet mignon, ordered medium rare, came to him charred. When he requested a new filet, he was given a near-raw one, and the owner made a very condescending comment about how meat is only tender if barely cooked. Anyone who has had a filet mignon prepared by someone competent knows this to be false, but the owner was quite rude and arrogant. Also, the lobster bisque was sub-standard, overwhelmed with sherry flavour, and the venison was dry. All items were priced typical to a French restaurant, but failed to have any quality that reflected upon their cost. We will never be dining there again, because of the poorly-prepared food, but most of all because of the unapologetic rudeness of the owner.
3	neg	dev	My Wife and I took some friends to this fairly new restaurant in wellesley recently. We were drawn there due to a gift certificate we recieved in the mail. Overall we were extremely pleased with the atmosphere, food and service , although surprisingly they were not very busy. We are from wellesley and have never heard of them. We were happy to discover them and be sure to tell all of our friends!!!!! Try them yourself, you won't be disappointed.
3	neg	dev	Unique college hang out. A Small house with several small unleval rooms off the enterance. Famous for their margarita's topped with sangria. Extensive menu of authentic mexican fare. Only one type of salsa is served and it is very hot. The staff is attentive and helpfull
3	neg	dev	Large family friendly restaurant located on the intercoastal. Nautical theme, menu is basic and limiting. Broiled and fried seafood comprise the majority of the menu. Great casual spot for drinks and a sunset---Marker 13 Outdoor Bar and Patio.
1	neg	dev	As a member of the gay community, I had heard goog things about Lickerish. I came in for a few drinks with a few friends of mine this past weekend. We were treated to an annoying server who could not keep his hands off of my boyfriend. I told him that he was annoying us but he continued to harrass us to the point that my friends wanted to leave. I am not in the service industry but I do beieve that a server should leave us alone unless we iinitiate conversation. We were there to enjoy each others company, not to be treated like animals by a repulsive server. I am sure that others in our community would feel the same way!!!! I am making sure that all of my friends know about him and will never step foot into Lickerish again as long as he is serving there!!!!
1	neg	dev	"Our experience was terrible. This place cannot handle a table with more than three/four guests. We were there on the day they began their ""bingo brunch"" and it soon became evidence that bingo was more important than food. Several of our orders were mixed up, didn't arrive at all and, in short, this place is a joke. Avoid it!!"
1	neg	dev	They seated me promptly, took my order then asked me to leave as they suddenly got busy. They said I had not ordered enough food and they had higher paying clients waiting. How rude to ask a family to leave when some arbitrary limit had already been set. I'll never go back.
1	neg	dev	Our worst nightmare...or close to it! There was a family at one of the tables around us that was allowing their small child to sit and stand on their table! Three tables were seated after us and their food ordered after ours. They all got their food before we did. We finally got our food when they were close to finishing. The food was only warm and the spanish rice was very dry, like it had been sitting for quite some time. The manager apologized and gave us our meal free. (I don't like having that happen. I'd much rather have better service, so I can pay for my meal.) Then we were brought complimentary desserts....and a check for the desserts we didn't order. (They then took back the ticket and said they had made a mistake and we could leave with the desserts. They had boxed them up.) I did leave a medium-sized tip for the server, even though my wife advised against it. According to another couple sitting next to us, they experience poor service at that restaurant about 1 out of every 3 times they go there. Once was enough for me, thanks.
2	neg	dev	If you are looking for rude and pompous, this is the place for you. Whoops, forgot expensive to boot.
2	neg	dev	My opinion, it was not very good service, there was some yelling going on between the employees.
1	neg	dev	"We were very happy to see the reviews and be able to get reservations for Valentine's Day 2004. My wife had the Lobster and I had the ""crockpot"" style roast beef. There were several bad experiences with the food but the highlight was when I cut the lobster open for my wife. All that was there was a grayish brown substance, in both the body and tail. The smell was like dead fish that had been left out to rot. We called it to the attention of the waitress and we were told that all of the lobsters that they had served that evening were like that! They apologized and we didn't have to pay for that dinner but I was charged for mine. I feel this was very poor customer service and that the lobster meat was very dangerous to the health of the customers. This was expecially sad since my wife and I were celebrating our 1st married Valentine's Day together."
2	neg	dev	The restaurant was ok but watch out for Jo and Ann those people work there and are very bitchy and cruel
1	neg	dev	This place is terrible. It has the worse service of any place in Boca Raton, with mediocre food. It's not cheap either. The owner is as arrogant as they come. This restaurant gave me indigestion.
2	neg	dev	"My husband and I just had a horrible experience with Thai 101 in Clinton Hill and will never go there or order from them again. We will certainly miss their food, but when we called in tonight to say that one of the dishes we had received in our delivery order was not correct, we were met with rude, snide, insulting service. The man who identified himself as the owner suggested that my husband was a liar; later, he suggested that my husband was crazy.   My husband told me later that he could hear the kitchen staff laughing in the background during his exchange with the owner. I heard the conversation from my husband's end, and while I won't deny that I'm biased, he was calm and polite throughout - from what I heard, the owner was angry and informed my husband that he did not care whether he lost us as customers - we simply wanted the dish that we had ordered.   The woman who identified herself as the manager also suggested that my husband was a liar, and when I got on the phone to describe the dish that we were expecting to get and referred to it as spicy, she mockingly said something to the effect of - ""spicy? That dish is not spicy. Who told you that dish is spicy?"" We were both very surprised - we ordered takeout from Thai 101 frequently, and again, all we wanted was the dish that we ordered. By the end of the conversation, an apology would have been nice too."
2	neg	dev	"Simply diguisted......There were four people in our party and we each ordered the Rib-Eye Steak (Medium Rare)........after a very long wait and upon arrival of our food, we ALL conluded that the steaks were overdone.......Oh well, it happens sometimes.......no big deal. The waiter was prompt and he apologized for the oversight. A couple of minutes later the owner comes out with our ""old"" steaks and starts to argue with us about the validity of our claim of overcooking the meat........he goes on and starts cutting into the meat at our table ""look it's medium""...............then he says the lighting is bad at the table......so he asks us to come to another spot in the restaurant with better lighting so we could ""see the red""........give me a break! Needless to say, we will NEVER eat there again."
