There were two Roosters in the same farmyard, and they fought to decide who should be master.  When the fight was over, the beaten one went and hid himself in a dark corner; while the victor flew up on to the roof of the stables and crowed lustily.  But an Eagle espied him from high up in the sky, and swooped down and carried him off.  Forthwith the other Rooster came out of his corner and ruled the roost without a rival.
